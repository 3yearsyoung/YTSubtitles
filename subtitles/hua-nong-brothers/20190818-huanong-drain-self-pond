大家好  上次我放這個魚塘啊
Hi everyone. Last time when I was draining the pond

那魚的  呃  那個池塘裡面的水 都沒有放乾淨
the fish..eh..I mean the water in the pond...was not completely drained.

我現在  拿這個抽水機啦  把它抽乾淨
I am now, using this draining machine, to drain all water

看一下 下面到底有甚麼東西
to see, what we can find under the water.

上次好像  好幾條大魚都沒有抓上來
It seems that last time, last time we could not catch the large fish.

現在
Now...

現在
Now...

現在兄弟家的池塘 全部都給我放完啦
Now I have drained up all my brother's ponds.

他家都沒池塘啦
He doesn't have pond any more.

只有放自己的池溏
I can only drain my own pond

看一下  下面  有沒有小魚
to see...if there are...any small fish.

大魚就沒有啦
There should be no more large fish.

哇! 這是黃骨魚
Wa! This is yellowhead catfish.

你看  這裡還有小龍蝦
See? Here's a crayfish too.

放 桶裡邊去
Put it...inside the barrel.

你看  這個是案板哦
See? This is an "anban" (cutting borad)!

你們叫砧皮 我們叫案板 叫菜板
You call it "chanban". We call it "anban" or "caiban".

這個是 看[SIC] (砍)骨頭用的
This is...for cutting bones.

好重呀  看一下這個
Very heavy! Look at it!

這個都泡了一年啦
It's been soaked for a year

還那麼硬  這是  松樹來的
and it's still that hard. That is...from a pine tree.

全部抓完就抓了那麼一丟丟
We've already caught everything. But it's so little.

可能之前水滿啦  全都跑出去啦
Perhaps they all ran away, when the water was full before.

肯定跑到這裡面去
They must have gone inside here.

一條都不見了
I can't even see one.

我放了好多那個蛇頭魚進去啦
I have put a lot of snakehead fish into the pond.

現在就沒有啦
Now there is none.

好啦  收工收工
Alright! Let's go! Let's go!

這個池子我們先曬幾天  曬乾一點
We'll leave the pond to dry, dry a bit more under the sun.

搞點生石灰消一下毒  然後我去兄弟家搞點魚
I'll sterilize it with some lime. Then I'll take some fish from my brother

放到這裡來
and put them here.

Let's clean the fish.

小龍壞好壞
Crayfish are bad guys.

現在這個魚都下完蛋啦
Now the fish have laid all the eggs

不會孵春啦
They won't hatch the eggs anymore.

Put mine at the edge and yours in the middle.

先烤這幾條吧
We grill these fish first.

架子太小啦
The frame is too small.

你看這個魚 黑不溜秋的
Can you see the fish? It's as black as ink.

全都被我弟烤的黑  烤黑啦
My brother has burnt....burnt them all.
