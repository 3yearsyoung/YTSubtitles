大家好  上次我放這個魚塘啊
Hi everyone. Last time when I was draining the pond...

那魚的  呃  那個池塘裡面的水 都沒有放乾淨
the fish..eh..I mean the water in the pond...was not completely drained.

我現在  拿這個抽水機啦  把它抽乾淨
I am now..using this draining machine...to drain all water...

看一下 下面到底有甚麼東西
to see...what we can find under the water.

上次好像  好幾條大魚都沒有抓上來
It seems that last time...last time we could not catch the large fish.

只有放自己的池溏

看一下  下面  有沒有小魚

全部抓完就抓了那麼一丟丟
We have already caught all but we still have just a little bit.

可能之前水滿啦  全都跑出去啦
Perhaps they all ran away...when the water was full before.

肯定跑到這裡面去

這個池子我們先曬幾天  曬乾一點
We leave the pond to dry...dry a bit more under the sun.
