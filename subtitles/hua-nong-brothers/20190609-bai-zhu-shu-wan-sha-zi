带出来溜达溜达
Took them out to have a walk here

这个沙堆上溜啊
A walk on this pile of sand

小狗帮我看着它 不要让它跑了
Watch them for me, puppy! Don't let them run away

跑到山上去 我们就捉不到它了
If they run into the mountain, we can't catch them any more

那么陡的 那么陡的沙埔它都可以爬得上去的哦
They can even climb such a steep sand pile

这个竹鼠应该会打洞的 现在都不打洞了
Bamboo rats are supposed to know how to dig. But they don't dig any more

被我关太久了
Maybe I caged them for too long

失去了 失去了那个野性
They have lost their... their wild nature

你看 这个狗去逗那个竹鼠

你看 两个人在这玩都好玩啊

如果竹鼠中暑啦 就可以用这个湿沙子啊
In case any bamboo rat gets a heatstroke, we can use wet sand

稍微把它这样 埋下去
to bury it shallowly like this

它身上的温度降下来就可以啦
Then its temperature can be decreased

你看这个 不打洞的这个
See? This one doesn't dig

不打洞的竹鼠不是好竹鼠哦
A bamboo rat who doesn't dig is not a good bamboo rat

你看 它们
Look at them

现在天气比较热哦
The weather is quite hot now

看它们 喜欢钻洞里面去啦 你看
They like to get into a hole. See?

这个就不喜欢 这个是它妈妈没教它打洞
This one doesn't like it. Maybe its mom didn't teach it how to dig

它就不会打
So it doesn't know how to dig

这个应该教啦
This one was educated

它就会打啦
So it knows how

这堆沙就是可以给竹鼠
This sand pile is for bamboo rats

竹鼠它们玩耍的
for bamboo rats to play

没事做的话 把它领出来
When there's time, I'll take them out

看看那个 那个听话一点的
See who are obedient

不然淋雨了就不好办了
Don't let them be wet. Or it's going to be bad

所以天晴的时候 我们就经常带出来给它们玩耍
So when it's sunny, we often take them out to play

就在这个沙堆上
here on the sand

本来想去沙滩的 但是我们这边没有沙滩啊
I planned to go to a beach. But there's no beach around

就是这个沙堆就可以了
Anyway, this pile of sand already works

反正这个竹鼠这么小
Since the bamboo rats are small

它也不知道 它也没见过沙滩啊
And they never knew. They haven't seen a beach anyways
