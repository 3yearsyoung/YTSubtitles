这个牛肉罩火烧（组成）简单来说就是
Basically, this "Niurouzhaohuoshao" ("beef with wheat cake") is

汤+牛肉+火烧
broth, beef and "huoshao" cake

火烧是泡在老汤里的
The "huoshao" cake was soaked in slow cooker broth

你要的时候 老板把火烧从锅里捞出来
When you order it, the cook takes it out from the broth

剁剁剁
and chop chop chop

大刀剁完放到碗里再加上老汤
It's chopped with a big cleaver and put in a bowl of slow cooker broth

放上切了薄片的牛肉
then topped with thin beef slices

就是这么着
That's the way!

最后撒上香菜
And finally it's topped with cilantro

这个是要的 9 块钱的牛肉罩火烧
This is a 9-yuan "Niurouzhaohuoshao" ("beef with wheat cake")

试试他这个汤是什么样的味道
Let's try the broth

其实单吃火烧也可以 单吃肉也可以
Actually, it's fine if you eat the cake only, or eat the beef only

但是 唯独单独喝汤 会有点咸
But if you drink the broth only, it's a little too salty

毕竟这里面是老汤
After all, it's slow cooker broth

所以颜色会感觉会是这种酱油色
so it looks a bit of the soy sauce color

上面零星地飘着一些油花
with some floating oil drops

一般做肉类的 有老汤会让肉更香一些
In general, a meat dish tastes better with slow cooker broth

这个也一样
So is this one

火烧剁得还好 没有很碎
The "huoshao" cake isn't chopped too finely. It's just right

所以说吃起来还有很多的嚼劲
with quite some chewiness

用筷子掐一下（火烧）
Try picking up (a piece of "huoshao")

每一个都是这么大的块
Every single piece is as big as this

牛肉切的很薄
The beef slices are really thin

还能够看到它的纹路
and we can still see the texture

我来的时候 人乌央乌央都朝着里面涌
When I came here, a large crowd of people were flooding into the shop

在这边排了差不多 10 多分钟才买到
I queued for about 10 minutes to get it

等到我把牛肉罩火烧端到桌子的时候
And when I was taking my dish to a table

发现中间走了很多人了
I found that a lot of people were gone

然后我就有位置了
So that's how I got a seat

吃着吃着 人又多了
And then more and more people came when I was eating

你看这个房间 其实挺封闭的
Look at this room. It's actually quite closed

天热 像蒸桑拿的感觉
On a hot day, it feels like a sauna room

大家坐这边吃饭边流汗
People are sweating when eating

还是坐门口离空调近 凉快
So it's better to sit near the entrance. It's closer to air conditioner and cooler

上次吃烙饼卷肉的时候
Last time when we had the "Laobing Juanrou" (meat with "laobing" cake)

小哥推荐了这边的烙饼
some bro recommended the laobing over there

说（可以）早上来尝一尝很不错
he said that it's great to have a try in the morning

这个是咱买的 12 块钱的
This is our 12-yuan laobing

烙饼卷菜卷肉
with vegetables and meat

咱要的是一个大份的
We bought a large one

因为今天要离开石家庄
As we are leaving Shijiazhuang today

所以说买一个大份的中午留在路上吃
we bought a large one as our lunch on the way

这一个大份的 你看
Such a large one. Look!

真的有我的胳膊这么粗
It's as thick as my arm

（不细吧）
(not a thin one)

拿着这一个 还是觉得很有分量的
You can feel the weight when holding it

他这个饼很薄
The laobing is quite thin

上面有一些做烙饼形成的小气泡
with some small bubbles made when baking

金黄色的
It's golden brown

他这个是油饼
This one is a "You Bing" ("oil-fried cake")

一拿出来的时候
As soon as you take it out

你就会觉得这个饼很香
you can feel how aromatic it is

他这边有好几盆的菜
The cook brought some bowls of ingredients

土豆丝 豆皮 洋葱 甘蓝
potato shreds, tofu skin, onions, cabbage

用大饼卷这些菜来吃
All to be wrapped in the laobing

如果说 想吃鸡蛋就加鸡蛋
It's like, you can add eggs if you want eggs

想吃鸡腿就加鸡腿
and you can add drumsticks if you want drumsticks

还有一种就是牛肉肠
And there's also beef sausage

可以把它放进去
which can also be put inside

只有洋葱是生的 其他的全是熟的
Only the onion is raw. Everything else is cooked

再说 那几个 生的也不能吃
After all, those things can't be eaten as raw

烙饼的量是很大的 把薄饼卷了满满的菜
The size is quite big. The laobing is full of stuff in it

饼是很薄 很有韧劲
The laobing is pretty thin, and chewy

有这种油饼的香味
with the aroma of "You Bing"

饼本身就是有味道的 咸的
The laobing itself is already seasoned. It's salty

现在知道大哥 问我能不能吃洋葱
Now I realized why the bro asked if I prefer onions

其实饼一打开的时候 你就能闻到
As soon as you open it, you can smell

洋葱的那种生涩、生辣的味道
the strong smell of raw onions

他这个鸡腿原来是整个的
The drumstick was cooked as a whole

卖的时候 他会吧鸡骨头从鸡腿当中拽出来
When sold, the bone is taken out

这样 吃起来就没什么压力了
So it's easier to eat

这一条街 都是卖早餐的
This street is full of breakfast shops

很多人买完烙饼到别的店里
Many people would buy a laobing, and then go to other shops

要一碗老豆腐 配着烙饼来吃
order a bowl of firm tofu, and eat it with the laobing 

一早上 饱饱的
So you end up satisfied in the entire morning

这个老豆腐 看上去很像打碎的豆腐
This firm tofu looks like shredded tofu

一块一块的
It's in small pieces

吃起来一点都不嫩
It's not tender at all

口感有点扎实
It feel a bit firm in your mouth

因为里面放了一点辣椒油 吃起来有点辣味
And it's a bit spicy, because there's a little chili oil in it

很多时候大家说
For many times, I was told

哎呀 雪鱼 你要把你的视频
"Aiya, Xueyu, you gotta make your videos

变得更加有文采
more fancy"

多说些让人觉得这些小吃很了不起的话
"You should say something that makes people think those street foods are marvelous" or things like that

其实我做的 大部分做的都是
After all, most of my videos are

我们平常的美食
about the food in our daily life

吃饱 就可以了
If it makes you full, that's good enough

你看很多我做的都是
It's like, I've filmed a lot of thing

量大实惠（的类型）
that are big and economic

当然有的时候 也会找一些比较特别的
Of course, sometimes I'll go for some specialties

它不拘一 但是大多数的还是这种
It's not limited. But most of the things are still

量大 实惠 让普通人吃饱的
big, cheap, and make ordinary people satisfied

它可能不美观
It might not look very beautiful

但是对于我们平常人来说
But for ordinary people like us,

吃饱 就已经很满足了
we are already very satisfied after getting full
