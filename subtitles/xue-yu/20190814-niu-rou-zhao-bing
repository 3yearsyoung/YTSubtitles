牛肉罩饼
Stewed beef "zhaobing" (zhao = over, bing = flatbread tortilla)

罩饼在哪里拿
Where do I get the zhaobing?

坐下点
Order after sitting down

这个罩饼前面是肉，后面是饼
The zhaobing has meat on the top, and bing on the bottom.

就是一两肉，一两饼
Basically 1 liang (1 liang = 50 grams) meat, 1 liang bing.

你看它菜单上写的是 罩饼
Look at the menu, it says "zhaobing"

前面是肉，后面是饼
Meat on the top, bing on the bottom

一罩一的牛肉罩饼是11块钱
1 over 1 ratio of beef to zhaobing is 11 RMB

一罩二的牛肉罩饼也是11块钱
1 over 2 ratio of beef to zhaobing is also 11 RMB

只要肉一样，饼多加一两不要钱
As long as the meat quantity is the same, you can add another ounce of bing for free

菜单后面是热菜
Back of the menu are the hot veggies

我感觉很多的种类
I feel there's lots of variety

很多的菜品都是我没有见过的
Lots of dishes that I've never seen before

我要一个青豆炒牛柳
I'd like 1 order of green peas with cubed beef

再要这个罩饼，要一个二罩二的把
Add this zhaobing, 1 order of the 2 over 2

二罩二的
2 over 2

一份？
1 order?

对
Yes

先付钱还是待会再付钱
Pay now or pay later

待会付钱还是现在付
Pay later or pay now

待会
Later

可以
Ok

等吃完了再付钱
Pay after you're done eating

谢谢
Thanks

一个青豆炒牛柳，一个二罩二
1 order green peas with cubed beef, 1 order of 2 over 2 (zhaobing)

对 对 对二罩二罩饼
Yes, yes, yes 2:2 zhaobing

我给你放下，你可以试一下
I'll put it on the table for you to try.

不是谁想端就端的 这个
You can't just lift it at will, this one

因为太烫了
(Because it's too hot)

小心你的手
Careful your hands

上来这个罩饼，我明白了
On receiving the order, I finally understand

其实这家店，已经从一个小吃店
Actually this restaurant, started from a small deli

升级为一个饭店
And grew into a large restaurant

连罩饼都是用盘子装的
Even the zhaobing have plates

上面就是二两的牛肉，下面罩了二两的饼
On top is 2 liang (100 grams) of beef, bottom is 2 liang of bing

咱们要的是20块钱的二两（牛肉罩饼）
We got the 20 RMB 2 liang beef zhao bing

下面的饼是手撕的
The bottom bing is hand torn

现在有点泡囊了
It's absorbed the soup

上面是能看到纹理的牛肉
On top is beef, you can see the striations

其实如果这么吃牛肉会有点干
Honestly eating the beef straight is a bit dry

所以把牛肉泡在汤里，口感更好一些
So soak it in the soup, the mouthfeel is a bit better

很多人来点餐的时候都会说
When ordering, a lot of people will say

来个几罩几
"Give me X over Y"

我突然明白，他们好像说的是
I suddenly understood, they seem to say

用几两的牛肉 罩住几两的饼
Use X liang beef to cover Y liang bing

就像这样
Like this

你把牛肉掀开就仿佛是牛肉罩住了饼
If you move the beef, it kind of looks like the beef is covering the bing.

牛肉对饼说，兄弟我罩着你
(Says the beef to the bing) I got you covered bro

吃起来有一种牛肉清香的味道
When eating, there is a light aromatic beef taste

吃到半截 我发现了这个
Ate half the meal when I realized

辣椒
Hot pepper!

其实这个牛肉罩饼 很像牛肉汤的味道
Actually this beef zhaobing, has a taste similar to beef soup

没有很咸
Not very salty

如果说 觉得咸度不够的话
If you think it's not salty enough

可以要一碗这样的辣椒
You can ask for a bowl of hot peppers like this

这个辣椒是鲜的 你看
These hot peppers are very fresh, look

鲜的青辣椒 蒜瓣这些东西泡出来的
Fresh green hot peppers, garlic mix, all pickled together

它这个就是 鲜中带点辣
This means amidst the fresh taste, a bit of spicy

然后带点咸味
And a bit of salt

配牛肉罩饼 挺好的
Paired with the beef zhaobing, it's great

不要觉得我今天来的地方很荒凉
This place is a bit in the boonies

但是这边真的有很多人来排队吃饭
But over here, there are a lot of people waiting in line to eat
