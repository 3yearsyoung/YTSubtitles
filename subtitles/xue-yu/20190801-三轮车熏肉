A: 最开始还没走过来的时候
Before I came here

我以为大家在一个药房前排队
I thought people were lining before this pharmacy

（以为是排队领鸡蛋）
(Thought they were lining for eggs)

走近一看才发现
Then I came close

（排队目标）在前面呢
and found that the target is still ahead

（三轮车上的熏肉摊）
(Smoked meat sold on a pedicab)

B: 排半天队不容易，多买点
It's not easy lining for so long. Why not buy some more

省得老排队
to save some lining time

（老年人：明天就开始吃剩的）
(Seniors: Then I have to eat leftovers tomorrow)

慢走
Have a nice day!

（总算到我了）
(My turn, eventually)

C: 这是啥啊？
What's this?

B: 这是心
Heart

C: 多少钱？
How much?

B: 10 块钱，10 来块钱
10 RMB or so

A: 这个怎么卖啊？

B: 都不一样价
Different prices

A: 猪头肉呢？
How about pork head?

A: 啊？多少钱一斤？
Pardon? How much?

A: 多少？35？
How much? 35?

A: 给我拿 10 块 20 的吧

A: 小一点 小一点的

A: 可以切吗？

B: 14 块钱
14 RMB

A: 这个肠多少钱？

B: 46 一斤
46 RMB for 500g

A: 这个香菜是随便拿的是吧？
And this cilantro is for free?

B: 拿吧
Go ahead

A: 揪一点就行
Just a little bit

A: 可以 可以 可以了
Enough, that's enough

A: 咱们买了两种
We bought two kinds of stuff

一种是猪头肉
One is pork head

临走的时候 又要了一点大肠
Before we left, we bought some pork intestine

还拽走了一根香菜
And took a cilantro

猪头肉 14 块钱，猪大肠 15 块钱
Pork head for 14 RMB, and pork intestine for 15 RMB

这一打开塑料袋
As soon as you open the bag

里面的卤肉的味道都蹿出来了
the smell of the master stock meat is rising up

颜色红且深
The color is amberish red and deep

这边都是肥的了
This part is all fat

我不知道为什么 刚才闻着这猪头肉 有一点酒味
I don't know why but I smelled alcohol from the pork head

而且有什么东西
And you know what

我顺势一撕猪头肉
I tried tearing the meat

很容易就把肉撕开了
It was easy

（炖的时间久了）
(It's stewed for a long time)

这个肉是熏肉 颜色深
The meat is smoked with a deep color

有微微的熏烤的味道
There's a mild smoked and grilled taste

嗯 有这种卤肉的香味
Hmm, and the smell of master stock meat

唉 肉让我沉醉
Ah, I love this meat so much

瘦肉当中 你能吃到肉汤、肉冻的这种感觉
From the lean meat, there's a taste of soup and aspic

一些卤汤、老汤的味道
And flavors of master stock and broth

已经浸入到瘦肉当中
are deep in the lean meat

肥肉因为炖的时间比较久一点
Since it's stewed for quite long

这些肥油已经渗出来了一部分
some of the fat has come out

所以吃起来没有那么油腻
so that fat part isn't so oily

（减少油腻 并不能消灭油腻）
(Reduced oiliness is not zero oiliness, though)

这个大肠 我们只是买了两条吧
We bought like two strips of this pork intestine

不能叫两条 就是两块
Actually, it's not two strips. Just two pieces

她可能中间有把它剁开的
Maybe she chopped it from the middle

嚼呀嚼呀嚼
And it's quite chewy

得嚼好久才能嚼得烂 嚼足一百八十下
It takes a lot of chewing

最后因为分量不够 让了一点猪肝
Finally, as it's short in weight, we got some pork liver

不过我发现很多人都是
However, I found that

要一大块 一整块的猪肝带走
many people prepfer to buy a full big chunk of pork liver

咱这就是压个秤的
And ours is just for filling up the weight

（这个不用展示了吧 你拿一下 。。。 有点怪异）
(Do we really need to demonstrate this?)
(Try holding it)
(...)
(It's a little weird)
