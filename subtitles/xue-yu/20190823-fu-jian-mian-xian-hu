今天早上咱们来吃的是面线糊
We have mianxianhu as breakfast this morning

加大肠是因为我看到
I added large intestine because I noticed that

很多人来买的时候
People often add large intestine 

都是拿大肠垫底的
when they ordered mianxianhu

咱们也加上大肠
So let's also add some large intestine

还有呢 就是醋肉
And they have vinegar pork

他们说 醋肉是泉州的特色嘛
They said vinegar pork is special dish in Quanzhou

把醋肉加到面线糊里来吃
There is a special flavor 

有一种独特的味道
if we add vinegar pork into mianxianhu

油条 就是 怎么说呢
I order youtiao because 

早上起来习惯吃油条
I used to eat youtiao in the morning

但是我看这边的主食好像也只有油条
and I also noticed that they only have youtiao as their main 

可能有别的 没有注意到
They might have others but I didn't notice that

这一碗就是
Here we go

这一碗加上油条 一共是16块钱
Total is 16 yuan

勺进去了 怎么还
How did I drop the spoon into the bowl...

（我已经整理好了）
(It's nice and clean now)

你看刚才 叔叔做面线糊的时候
They used scissors to cut large intestine and put it 

他是把大肠剪完 铺到碗底下
at base of the bowl when they were making this

浇上一碗清糊
and covered it with mianxianhu

再放上胡椒粉 香葱这些
Then they added pepper powder and chopped green onion

他还舀上了一勺卤汁
They also add a spoon of gravy

所以说 这么闻起来
So when you smell it

还有一种蒜的味道
there's some garlicky flavor as well

这几天吃了很多次面线糊
We had a lot of mianxianhu recently

这碗面线糊其实相对来说
Relatively speaking, this bowl of mianxianhu

还是比较稀薄一点
is thinner than the others

面线看起来很像这种细毛线
The "mianxian" looks like thin wool

我看到它的时候 总感觉它好像煮化了
It looks like melted in the soup

但实际上 它的形还是没有变的
But actually, it's still there in its shape

他这个面线糊
The mianxianhu sold here

一般是用大骨头或者海鲜熬出来的
is made with slow cooker broth of bones or seafood

所以喝起来很鲜美
So it is delicious

来吃面线糊 我觉得这个料有更多的看点
I'm more interested in those ingredients

因为你看店家这边摆了好多料
As you see, they provide a lot of ingredients

你想吃什么可以随便朝里面加什么
You may add anything you like

你看 咱们这个清糊是两块钱
Mianxianhu only is 2 yuan

但是你加了大肠 加了醋肉加了其他的
If u add large intestine and vinegar pork and something else

可能价格就要高很多
it might be more expensive

其实面线不会像北方的面条需要咀嚼
Unlike noodles, Mianxianhu doesn't need chewing

它是直接就是一口喝下去就可以了
Just drink it

根本就不需要咀嚼
No need to chew

我们尝一尝大家都在加的大肠和醋肉
Lets try large intestine and vinegar pork

是什么样的味道
What kind of flavor is it?

爽脆？
Crispy?

没有异味
No stink smell?

有嚼劲？
Chewy?

算了他们听过很多次了
Whatever. They might have heard that for many times

我还是安静低吃完早饭吧
Let me just finish my breakfast quietly

都是这些老主顾经常来吃的
These are all old customers

这边是三四十种配料
We have a few dozens of ingredients here

迎合客人的口味啊
to match all kinds of customers

而且肉比较多
And most of them are meat

肉有 还有海鲜呢
We have meat and seafood as well

肉和海鲜
Meat and seefood

海鲜 海鲜 海鲜 海鲜
Seafood, seafood, seafood, seafood

这些全都是海鲜
These are all seafoods

几十种
A few dozen kinds

大叔 咱们这边吃面线糊
Is it common to add large intestine

是习惯加大肠吗
while enjoying mianxianhu here?

想吃什么就加什么
Add whatever you like

我看很多人都加大肠
I noticed that a lot people order large intestine

大肠 我们这边的大肠比较好吃
Our large intestine is more delicous

十几年就是这种
And it's been like that for several decades

除了油条 十几年都是这个
except youtiao

等一下来 你就要排队吃了
You're gonna line up if you come later

猪血 猪血这么早没有
Pork blood is gonna come later

大肠吧
Large intestine

大肠 还要什么
Anything else?

醋肉
Vinegar pork

很多人来吃面线糊
A lot of people came for Mianxianhu

不仅想要加大肠 还想加猪血
Not just large intestine, they added pork blood as well

但是这个猪血可能没有那么早做出来
But pork blood is made later in the day

想吃还又吃不到
so you can't always get what you want
