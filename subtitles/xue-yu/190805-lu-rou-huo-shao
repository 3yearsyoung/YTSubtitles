稍微大點的
A larger one

把那個拆開吧
Open up that one

拿脆火燒
Get a crispy huoshao (pan fried flatbread)

它這邊有兩份驢肉
There are 2 donkey meat vendors here

緊挨着兩家都是做驢肉的
These two next door to each other are both donkey meat vendors.

多少錢
How much


這邊吃還是帶走 (在這邊吃)
For here or to go (for here)


不賴 真來看 嚇一跳
Not bad, came here to check it out, surprised me!

給我拿10個
Give me 10

哦拿吧
Ok take it

差幾個
Missing a few

(做火燒的師傅向我展示他做的火燒) 哦 這好看 
(Huoshao cook shows me the ones he made) These look great

(我要關上了)
(I'm covering it)

還有嗎現在
Any more left?

火燒馬上出爐
(Huoshaos are almost ready)

來兩個板腸肉的 來倆肥瘦的
Give me 2 sausage, 2 fatty/lean meat mixed.

你進去盛粥去吧
Go inside to get your congee.

咱們在外面吃吧
Let's eat outside

外面下雨呢
It's raining

你這個粥不能淋雨的
You don't want to get rainwater on your congee

經常來吃的都回說要肥瘦的還是板腸肉的
The regulars usually just say "I want a lean/fatty stuffed" or "I want a sausage stuffed"

像我這種第一次來吃的可能就會說
Newbies like me would probably say

來一個驢肉的
"I'll have a donkey meat stuffed"

大姊這個怎麼賣 分部位嗎
Auntie, how much are these? By different cuts?

不分
No

我要兩個
I want two


多點瘦的就行
Leaner ones are fine

16塊錢
16 RMB

在這兒吃
I'll eat it here

(我要3個)
I want 3

(兩個純肉多少錢) 16
How much for 2 meat-onlys? 16

走吧
Let's go

(裡面還有剁肉的)
There are butchers inside

我第一次見這麼買驢肉的
My first time seeing donkey prepped like this

它這邊(外面)是兩個案版賣驢肉
There are 2 bulletin boards (outside) advertising donkey meat

肉的上面你看著白花花的都是肥油
On top of the meat, the white marbling is fat

下面是瘦肉
Underneath is the lean meat

如果你想要純瘦的(驢肉)也可以
If you want just lean cuts (donkey meat), that's ok too

想要加點肥的也可以
You can also get fattier cuts.

咱這個就是瘦的多一點肥的少一點
This one is more lean less fatty.

8塊錢一個賣了兩個
8 RMB each, bought 2

火燒是剛做出來的
Huoshao is freshly made

巴掌大
About the size of a palm

裡面是塞滿了肉
It's stuffed full with meat

火燒從外面看沒什麼特別的
The outside of the huoshao doesn't look very special

但是裡面是有點螺絲狀的
The interior is a bit whirl shaped.

裡面是有點稍微分塵的 (這個手勢像極了剛學算盤時候的樣子)
There are slight layers to it (gestures like a student learning how to use an abacus)

沒錯他這邊就是徒手剁肉
Yes, this is done by a butcher hand chopping the meat

(把肉)塞進去
Manually stuffing it in

張開了一個半口
Spreading open half of the opening

這個最大的特點就是皮酥肉香
The most unique characteristic is that the bread is crispy and the meat is fragrant

一咬還嘴上流油
One bite and my mouth is dripping oil

如果說只是吃瘦驢肉的話肉會有點乾
If you only order lean meat, it will taste a bit dry

加點肥肉會比較好吃
Add some fatty meat, will taste better

驢肉火燒很單純
Donkey huoshao is very simple

沒有青椒沒有香菜這些
No green bell peppers, no cilantro etc.

只有驢肉加火燒
Just donkey meat + huoshao.

驢肉剁的不是像肉泥的狀態
The donkey meat is not butchered into a ground texture

所以吃起來還是有點嚼的意思的
So when you eat it there is still a chew.

驢肉不算很鹹 放在裡面剛好
Donkey meat isn't really salty, stuffed inside it's perfect

還有它這邊的棒子面粥和鹹菜都是免費的
Also over here, the cornmeal porridge and pickled vegetables are free

隨便吃隨便喝
Eat drink as you wish

但是適量而行
But within reason

早上起來就下雨不過感覺涼快了很多
It started raining when I got up, but it feels cooler.
