（福建 泉州）

(Quanzhou, Fujian)

现在天已经下雨

It's raining now

我站在大棚的下面

I'm standing here under a roof

闻着对面的肉香味

smelling the delicious meat on the other side

但是他这个肉香味

But this meat aroma

还夹带着点醋味

there's also the smell of vinegar inside

瞬间会觉得饿了

which suddenly made me hungry

所以呢 趁雨还没有下大

So, let's go there and have a try

咱们去买点尝一尝吧

before the rain gets heavier

------

B: 你要什么？
What would you like?

A: 这个是有什么口味的吗？
What types are there?

B: 不分口味 只有种类不同

Which kinds?

A: 给我称 10 块钱的吧
I'll have 10 yuan worth

B: 10 块钱的
10 yuan

A: 过去了
I'm going to the seats

A: 哦 还是热的
Oh, it's still hot

------

我们正好买了 10 块钱的醋肉
We bought some vinegar meat for 10 yuan

在这个地方边避雨边吃东西
And sit here to enjoy while it's raining outside

咱们 10 块钱差不多买了 8 块左右
For 10 yuan, we got about 8 pieces of meat

他这个醋肉看起来很像酥肉
Their vinegar meat looks quite similar to a "Su Rou" (another fried meat)

（两者）外面都是过了面糊炸出来的
Both are coated and fried

但是（醋肉）闻起来多了一股醋的味道
But this one has the smell of vinegar

这种醋就像我们平时炒土豆丝
It's like the same vinegar used

放的醋的味道
when we make a shredded potato stir fry

（这是你炒的土豆丝）
（厨房黑洞）
（从土豆丝的设想 到土豆块的诞生）
(This is your home made shredded potato stir fry)
(BLACK HOLE KITCHEN)
(Planned shredded potato, got potato chunks)

------

一口咬下去
In one bite

除了醋的香味
Besides the flavor of vinegar

还有蒜的香味
there's also the aromatic fragrance of garlic

这个醋肉是提前腌制过的
The vinegar meat is pre-marinated

再加上他没有炸的很干
And they didn't over-fry it to dryness

所以 你一口咬下去
So, in one bite

觉得汤汁是酸口的
there's sour juice coming out

还夹着蒜香的味道
together with a garlicky flavor

醋肉最开始趁热吃的时候
When the vinegar meat is still very hot

你不会觉得它很酥脆
you probably won't feel much crispness

因为它外面的面很少 但是肉很多
because there's not much coating outside the chunk of meat

几乎每一个都是一个大肉块
Basically, every piece is a big chunk of meat

------

（放凉一下）
(A little cooled down)

现在好点
Now it's better

现在外面有这种脆壳了
Now there's a crispy coating outside

咱们慢慢吃
Let's take our time and enjoy it

毕竟这个天气也不允许我们快吃
We can't rush in weather like this anyways

------

确实是第一次吃这种酸溜溜的炸肉
It's my first time having sour fried meat like this

但是加了醋之后 你会觉得
But with vinegar added, it's like

这个炸的东西 变得也没那么腻
the fried things aren't (don't taste) as greasy

------

咱们是从天亮吃到天黑
We've been eating from dawn till dark

但是现在天黑了
Now it's dark

也还是没有走呢
And yet we are still here

------
