(Quanzhou, Fujian)

0:00:01.920,0:00:03.580
Today, we're going to buy some taro cakes.
(Quanzhou, Fujian)

0:00:03.580,0:00:05.700
Even though the auntie starts selling at 5 o'clock,

0:00:05.740,0:00:07.140
starting from 4 o'clock,

0:00:07.140,0:00:09.100
there's already a lot of people lining up.

0:00:09.100,0:00:10.460
It's 4:30 right now,

0:00:10.460,0:00:12.515
and we already got quite a long line here.

0:00:13.160,0:00:14.360
(Waiting...)

0:00:22.180,0:00:25.300
(Keep waiting...)

0:00:28.640,0:00:29.820
Standing at this position of the line,

0:00:29.820,0:00:31.180
I'm worried if I can get one.

0:00:32.720,0:00:34.720
(The line is even longer)

0:00:45.940,0:00:48.640
(Taro cakes are carried to here)

0:01:05.920,0:01:08.220
(And they are sold out fast)

0:01:14.880,0:01:16.280
(Head of the line)

0:01:37.440,0:01:39.440
Here's 7 cakes.

0:01:40.760,0:01:44.600
7... 7... times 3.5...

0:01:45.940,0:01:47.160
24.5 yuan.

0:01:53.420,0:01:54.560
I'll put it here.

0:02:00.405,0:02:01.405
42 yuan, right.

0:02:02.405,0:02:04.885
(WeChat payment received, 42 yuan)

0:02:10.080,0:02:12.520
Are there only two flavors, auntie?

0:02:12.720,0:02:14.260
Sweet and salty?

0:02:14.260,0:02:16.260
I'll have three of them each.

0:02:18.440,0:02:19.420
Three cakes.

0:02:19.420,0:02:20.820
How much are three cakes?

0:02:21.520,0:02:22.120
21 yuan.

0:02:35.415,0:02:36.415
(WeChat payment received)

0:02:36.700,0:02:37.920
(7 yuan)

0:02:42.900,0:02:45.160
When we just got the taro cakes,

0:02:45.160,0:02:46.520
they were still a little hot.

0:02:46.520,0:02:48.640
Now, they are not that hot already.

0:02:49.320,0:02:52.240
There are sweet and salty flavors.

0:02:52.360,0:02:53.240
3.5 yuan each.

0:02:53.240,0:02:55.740
Marked differently with black or white sesame.

0:03:01.760,0:03:03.240
Their taro cakes...

0:03:03.555,0:03:06.395
are like two cakes with stuffing in the middle.

0:03:06.575,0:03:09.475
Possibly coated with some fried starch coating.

0:03:11.220,0:03:13.620
I don't know which one is sweet or salty.

0:03:13.620,0:03:14.980
Let's check this one,

0:03:14.980,0:03:16.640
the one with white sesame.

0:03:23.320,0:03:24.580
There's mashed taro in the middle.

0:03:26.095,0:03:27.095
It's sweet.

0:03:36.380,0:03:38.840
Actually, with a bite in this taro cake,

0:03:38.840,0:03:42.115
you may find the cake kind of crispy.

0:03:42.120,0:03:44.040
However, the mashed taro

0:03:44.040,0:03:45.600
is both thick and mashy.

0:03:45.600,0:03:48.180
It has just the right level of sweetness,

0:03:48.180,0:03:49.960
so you don't feel greasy or cloying.

0:03:50.560,0:03:52.640
As there's some white sesame,

0:03:52.640,0:03:55.060
the aroma of white sesame is quite obvious.

0:03:55.060,0:03:56.840
So the overall smell is better.

0:04:10.815,0:04:12.975
Speaking of this salty taro cake,

0:04:12.980,0:04:16.235
it's simply changing the sweet flavor of the last one into a salty flavor.

0:04:16.240,0:04:17.740
Still very tasty.

0:04:17.740,0:04:20.460
It's like, the two flavors can live together.

0:04:24.855,0:04:27.315
There're quite many people lining up for the taro cakes.

0:04:27.320,0:04:29.240
However, speaking of their comments,

0:04:29.320,0:04:31.020
there are quite different comments on

0:04:31.020,0:04:32.240
the taste of the cakes.

0:04:32.240,0:04:33.360
When I was leaving earlier,

0:04:33.360,0:04:35.780
I met some young bike riders.

0:04:35.780,0:04:38.295
One of them said, "Do you know what these people are lining up for?"

0:04:38.300,0:04:39.380
Another said it's taro cakes,

0:04:39.380,0:04:42.580
and they have tried it before but didn't feel anything special about it.

0:04:42.740,0:04:44.500
There might be hundreds of,

0:04:44.500,0:04:45.960
or thousands of people who have tried this food.

0:04:46.060,0:04:48.040
So their comments must be like,

0:04:48.040,0:04:49.520
there are both positive ones and negative ones.

0:04:49.800,0:04:52.605
It's impossible that the same food satisfies

0:04:52.605,0:04:53.605
everyone's taste, or preference.

0:04:54.205,0:04:56.155
(You can make it by yourselves)

0:04:56.580,0:04:59.100
Let me tell you something interesting.

0:04:59.100,0:05:00.720
We are Shandong people,

0:05:00.720,0:05:03.440
but every meal we had here is rice.

0:05:03.440,0:05:05.300
And, you know...

0:05:05.300,0:05:07.640
Our teeth are probably not quite used to that.

0:05:07.640,0:05:11.100
We kind of want something hard and chewy to work our teeth.

0:05:11.100,0:05:13.480
(We haven't had anything flour for long)
So today, as we planned taro cakes,

0:05:13.480,0:05:14.700
our buddy said,

0:05:14.700,0:05:16.720
"Finally, we can eat some "bing" (wheat flour cake)."

0:05:16.840,0:05:18.520
After, they are cakes.

0:05:18.520,0:05:19.980
Even taro cake has the word "cake".

0:05:19.980,0:05:21.820
We didn't expect that it's still soft.

0:05:22.140,0:05:24.420
(Life is always full of surprises)

0:05:33.420,0:05:34.120
Anything left here?

0:05:34.160,0:05:35.220
Sold out.

0:05:36.160,0:05:37.200
Is it this fast? (Yeah)

0:05:37.200,0:05:39.800
Auntie, how many cakes do you bring here everyday?

0:05:40.100,0:05:41.580
500 cakes.

0:05:41.580,0:05:43.020
And you leave after sold out. (Yeah)

0:05:43.480,0:05:44.280
(Customers checking if it's sold out...)

0:05:44.700,0:05:47.800
As you see, those people were buying in batches

0:05:47.800,0:05:49.440
of 40 or 50 cakes.

0:05:49.440,0:05:51.880
So it's sold out very fast. Never had enough to sell on any day.

0:05:51.880,0:05:54.000
No matter how much you make, it's always sold out.

0:05:54.000,0:05:57.660
Even I make 500 cakes, sometimes they are sold out in an hour.

0:05:57.660,0:06:00.360
So you make 500 cakes everyday. Can you make more?

0:06:01.200,0:06:04.780
If I want to make more, I need to get up earlier.

0:06:04.780,0:06:06.200
Got to get up earlier.

0:06:07.160,0:06:08.260
Sold out.

0:06:10.220,0:06:11.280
Sold out.

0:06:11.940,0:06:12.680
Sold out this fast?

0:06:12.680,0:06:14.360
Yeah, it's sold out.

0:06:14.620,0:06:15.680
Oh, my gosh.
