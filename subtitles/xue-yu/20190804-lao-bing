Spoons and pickles are over there.

行 拿点咸菜
OK. Let's get some pickles

稍微拿点吧夠吃就可以
Let's grab some. Just enough to eat.

噢，应该用这种小碗的。
Oh, I was supposed to use the little bowls

这就是7块钱的大饼。
This is the 7 yuan large pastry.

里面就像肉夹馍一样塞满了肉。
Looks like a rou jia mou (beef in a flour biscuit pocket), filled with meat

这个饼还是很厚实的。
The pastry layer is actually quite thick.

饼上有虎皮的斑纹。
The outer layer looks like tiger print.

要来一碗棒子面粥，先喝点粥吧。
I ordered a bowl of cornmeal porridge, let's have it first.

这个烙饼应该是加了葱，油，盐的。
This laobing was made with scallions, oil, and salt

好。是有（咸）味道的
Okay. It's got a salty (savory) flavor.

咱们把这个饼，咬下横截面你能发现它这个肉，就像肉丝和肉泥的状态。里面加了洋葱和青椒。
Let's bite it open and you can see from it's cross-section, the texture of the meat is in between meat strips and ground meat. Onions and chilis are also added.

真是饼香肉更香。
The pastry is aromatic but meat is even more fragrant.

它这个肉是有肥有瘦的。
The meat consists of fatty and lean cuts.

吃起来是很带劲。
When eating there is a satisfying texture.

噢喂。哎哟。肉又掉了
Ouch, lost a piece of meat.

我为什么说 这个很像肉夹馍
Why did I say it's like a rou jia muo?

只不过说把馍换成了饼。
It just replaces muo with laobing.

它这个肉也是带汤的。而且剁的很细。
The meat here is juicy and finely chopped

还有一点就是。你越吃，其实这个汤是浸入到饼当中的。
Another point is that the more you eat, the more the juices soak into the laobing.

吃到最后，如果不注意的话，汤很容易粘到手上。
At the end of the meal, if you aren't careful, the soup will stick to your your hands

如果说想吃辣，就再加点辣椒。
If you want more spiciness, just add some chili peppers

大哥，你帮忙说一句。
Mate, let me ask you a quick one

你是经常来这吃还是第一次来这吃？
Do you eat here for the first time or often?

我经常来这吃。
I often eat here

味道怎么样？
How does it taste?

味道很好。符合老百姓的口味。
Very good. It suits the average person's tastes.

来俩火腿的。
Two with Hams

主要就是吃一个实惠，大众口味。
Mainly for the sake of affordable eating combined with a population-appealing taste.

是，实惠。经济实惠，口感也好。
Yes, economical and practical, texture is nice too

饼不能擀的太薄了，太薄了吃不饱。
You don't want to roll the laobing too thinly, if it's too thin it won't fill you up.

反正我这里老顾客特别多，最起码能占到8成。
Anyways we have a surprising amount of repeat/loyal customers, up to 80%.

不少，这真不少。
Wow that's quite a bit.

搬到这边来了。
Moved the store here?

嗯
Yea.

前几天来了以为倒闭了，我说买卖这么红火怎么倒闭了。
I came here the other day and thought it was out of business. (Laobings) were selling so hot how could the store possibly close?

这里在装修的。
We're renovating the current location.

多少钱？
How much?

9块。
9 yuan

这么火还能倒闭了？
It's so popular! How could it possibly close?

是啊，我就说这么火怎么倒闭了。
