# 对 肉是一样的 只不过说签子不一样
Yes. The meat is the same but the skewers are different

# 签子烤出来就香一点 用那个红柳枝串的

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,120

53
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,440
# 一个顶三个
One skewer here is more fulfilling than three skewers elsewhere

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,600
# 吃完三个烤肉 感觉已经很饱了
I am already full after eating three of them

There's a naan-themed museum here. We're going in

61
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
# 什么是馕 说的天花乱坠 倒不如一看究竟
What's a naan? It's better to take a look than to listen

62
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,360
# 哇
wow

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,320
# 在文化馆里 摆放着几十种的馕

# 这个时候 尝 应该是加深记忆的一个好方法
So tasting should be a good way to deepen your memory

68
