哈囉，大家好我是王剛
Hello everyone, this is Wang Gang

我們家的房子已經基本全部完工
the house we have been building is near completion

這一個多月來說的話
Speaking of the past month,

確實非常辛苦
it has indeed been very difficult.

跟我想像當中修建一個房子是完全不一樣的
constructing a house is completely different from what I had originally imagined

可以看得出來我這個臉
you can tell from this face

還有這個從下面開始
or even from this area and below

手這個地方
to this arm

完全是兩個概念
completely two different skin tones

在家裡面打小工打了1個把月
been helping out on the construction for a month now

還是有一些變化
you can tell I have gone through some changes

第一是人瘦了變黑了
first, I lost weight and got tanned

然後精力各方面體力更加充沛
and I also gained strength and became more energetic

其實我伯爺老爸他們更加那個（辛苦）
my uncle and my father worked even harder than I did

因為他們天天在那裡幹
because they worked on the house every single day

起頭那一兩天幹起倒有勁兒
in the beginning we were very energetic

幹一兩天整疲倦了你看你還得不得行嘛
after a day or two of exhaustion, would you be able to continue?

再疲也沒得辦法得撒也要幹
no matter how exhausted, no way to quit, gotta finish

（菜地）幹的時候還要發點水（澆水）
(In reference to the garden area), while digging you have to add water

不是挖都挖不動
or else you won't be able to dig through

挖起起坨坨
Digging up mounds

那個泥巴嗎？
Do you mean the mud?

嗯
yeah

你以為
what else?

現在就好挖
but it's easier to dig now

挖的動
can be dug

這又不是牆泥巴都嘛
it's unlike the clay in the bricks

那種震緊了的你挖不動
Those compressed so tightly you wouldn't be able to dig through.

那這樣裡面還有石頭塊塊哟
so there is gravel in the mixture?

有
yeah

那個磨凳（石磨）還在裡面啊
is the mill stone still there?

磨盤
the runner stone

磨盤磨凳都在那裡
the runner stone and the bed stone are both there

磨盤可能在後面壓起得
the runner stone may be buried over there

這個（修房子）整完了我還是拿張紙來算哈（帳單）
now the house is completed I'll write down the costs on paper

算哈嘛
for what?

看大概用了多少錢
To see how much we've spent

水泥多少錢一吨
how much is a ton of cement?

水泥是460一吨
cement is 460 rmb per ton

470元
470 rmb

加了運費的嗎
does it include shipping?

沒加運費
not included

加了運費是多少
how much after shipping?

加運費10塊錢1吨
shipping is 10 rmb per ton

好啦
alright

我們這個算的差不多了
I've got most of it

經過我們剛才算了一下
Based on our estimates,

我紀了個帳
I did some basic accounting

水泥的話用了10吨
we used 10 tons of cement

470元一吨
470 rmb per ton

總共就是4700塊錢
total is 4700 rmb

然後就是鋼筋
next is rebar

3600一吨
3600 rmb per ton

用了1吨
we used one ton

然後還有這個石子
and we also used gravel

用了28吨
we used 28 tons of gravel

100塊錢1吨
100 rmb per ton

用了2800
so that's 2800 rmb

還有就是這個沙
and also the sand

用了24吨
we used 24 tons

150一吨
150 rmb per ton

就是3600塊錢
that's 3600 rmb

其實這些材料都不算特別貴
actually these materials are not super expensive

其中比較有爭議的一些東西
There are a few items that may have some conflicts,

我覺得就是這個磚跟瓦
that is the bricks and the tiles

我們這個瓦的話
the tiles we used

用了1.3萬塊
there are 13,000 pieces of them

3毛1一片
0.31 rmb per piece

總共的話接近4000塊錢
that makes almost 4000 rmb

有很多地方這個瓦他們已經不做了
most places (factories) have stopped producing these type of tiles

可能說有錢也買不到
in other words, you can't buy it even if you had the money

然後這個確實也不貴
truthfully, it's not expensive

再來就是這個磚
next, it's the bricks

3角7（分）1匹紅磚
0.037 rmb per red brick

用了2萬匹（塊）
we used 20,000 bricks

現在這個房子
on this house 

還剩了一些當然沒用完
we do have leftover bricks

再就是人工（工資）
next, it's the labour

我們請的人工都是附近的師傅
we hired workers from nearby

他們做事的速度是非常快的
they are very fast 

這個相對來說人工在速度上
relatively speaking, they are faster than most

在速度上面占一點優勢
in terms of speed, they have the competitive edge

這個價格平攤下來
so the cost was able to to average down

會小一些
a bit less

還有就是鏟車呀
and then there's the excavator cost

伙食費啊
meal cost for the workers

泥工的工資啊
labor cost for the concrete workers

還有這個壩子的材料費這些算起來
and the material costs for all of these

其實還好
Actually it's (the sum) OK.

所以我們到目前為止合計起來總共花了
So up till now, we've spent in total

63300塊錢
63,600 rmb

很多粉絲問我們為什麼不修兩層呢
many fans asked why we didn't build a two story home.

其實我們也想修兩層
We actually wanted to.

但是我們樓房上面怕那個電線
but because of the electric wires up there

直接就限制了我們
we were limited (in height)

因為我們不可能為了修兩層樓
we couldn't take down the electric wires 

就把這個已經牽好的電線把它拆掉
just to build a two story house

這是不可能的
that's just not doable.

再一個修成小青瓦
As for the curvy shaped tiles

主要是夏天
mainly because in summer 

大家也知道四川是很熱的
you all know Sichuan is very hot

夏天的話就沒有那麼熱
but in summer time it is not as hot (comparably)

其實我們這樣子修的話
Actually because of the way we did the reconstruction,

第一是省了很多事情
first, we saved a lot of hassles

因為你要擴建這些
because if we were to simply increase the size (of the old house)

會要到審批這一步
we would have to go through permit process

我們這個就是直接在老的屋基上面
what we did was we built on top of the old foundation

把地基推倒了重新返修了一層
we deconstructed the foundation and built another layer

就不用需要太多的一些麻煩的手續
so we didn't need to go through complicated processes

還有最後最重要的一個點
and most importantly, 

修成這個樣子是我父親的意思
this is what my father wanted

他喜歡住這種房子
he likes to live in houses such as this

因為以前是泥房
because back then houses were built with mud

在他們那個年代就希望以後能夠住得上這樣的小青瓦
their generation dreamed of living in a house with curly roof tiles just like this.

這完全是出於我老爸的意願來修的
this house is built upon the wishes of my father

然後這段時間房子也修好了
now the house is finished

我也會經常在這邊拍一些美食視頻
I will also start making cooking videos here

就是更加接地氣的家常菜
more homey, local dishes

希望大家多多的支持
I hope you can support me

好啦本期視頻就到這裡
Okay, that's the end of the vlog for this week.

謝謝大家的支持
Thank you everybody for your support.

拜拜
bye bye
