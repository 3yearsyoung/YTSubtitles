哈喽大家好我是王刚
Hello everyone, this is Wang Gang

本期视频是想和大家解释一下
In this video, I’d like to clarify...

关于为什么最近总是在四伯家拍视频
...why I’ve always been shooting the videos at my uncle’s house lately

因为前一些时间我们四川这边有些地震
One of the reasons is the recent earthquakes in Sichuan

所以我们这个工作室也受到了一些影响
that had done some damage to our studio 

最近在进行维修当中 暂时不能使用
We temporarily will be unable to use the studio as we are repairing it 

然后因为我的父母他们年纪大了
And then because my parents are getting old

他们更愿意在老家的祖屋生活
They kinda prefer to live in my hometown, and in the old house 

所以这段时间我把我的时间全部用在了修祖屋这个事情上
That’s why I spent all my time in repairing the old house recently

也让老人有个落脚的地方
So that the elders can have a place to settle down

按照我们四川人当地的想法
We Sichuanese often think that 

就是外面的世界再好都不属于我们自己
no matter how beautiful the outside world is, it’s still alien to us

正所谓有一句话怎么说来着
As the old saying goes:

金窝银窝不如自己的狗窝
“a house of gold or silver is never as good as my own tumbledown home（East or West，Home is best）”

而我作为他们的子女应该尊重父母的意愿
I shall respect my parents’ decision as their son

还有很多粉丝问为什么我的父母很少上镜这个问题
Then there are lots of fans asking me about why my parents rarely appear in the videos 

因为我的父母都是属于那种比较内向的人不善于表达自己
That’s because both of them are somewhat introverted and rather shy when expressing themselves 

他们看着镜头会非常不自在
They feel extremely uncomfortable facing the camera 

像我四伯他就正好例外
Nevertheless my uncle is an exception

他看着镜头就非常自然
He does not feel anything in front of the camera 

还有一些粉丝给四伯取了个外号“火云邪神”
Some fans even gave my uncle a nickname—“The Beast” [from Kungfu Hustle]

在这里我要给大家解释一下
I’d like to clarify that

这个外号是粉丝给四伯取的
This nickname is given by the fans 

也许是我们这些粉丝想借此机会向星爷表达致敬
It might be that our fans want to take this opportunity to show their respect and admiration to Mr. Stephen Chow 

最后还是说下我自己吧
Lastly I want to talk a little bit about myself 

其实我还是很想好好的在家里陪一下家人
Actually I want to take my time staying home with my family 

以前我从小不到三岁就是一个留守儿童
I used to be a “left-behind child” since I was less than three 

父母都不在身边
My parents were barely around

然后交个我外公外婆寄养
And then I was sent to my grandparents who fostered me 

到了十四五岁的时候又因为学厨艺东奔西跑
Once I turned fifteen, I had to move from pillar to post to study culinary skills 

也没在父母身边相处过
I wasn’t with my parents then

所以我觉得跟家里人相处的时间太少了
So I think I just spent too little time accompanying them 

当然了在家我的视频还是会继续拍下去
But I will certainly produce more videos during my time at home 

我会尝试着以大家最容易看懂
The new culinary videos will be made in a 

容易学会的的方式继续跟大家拍美食视频
simpler and easier-to-follow manner 

虽然这段时间我拍视频的频率少了
Though I shot less videos recently 

但是大家放心这只是暂时的
please be assured that this won’t last long 

就是这一个月当中我会把家里面的事情处理好
I will take care of all the things of my family within this month 

包括祖屋的修建各方面弄好了之后我会回来继续努力拍美食视频
Including repairing the old house etc., and after that I will come back shooting more culinary videos 

我会继续加油创作—然后谢谢所有粉丝对我的包容
I will try hard for better content. And thanks to all the fans for their understanding 

谢谢粉丝这两年多来对我的支持
Thanks to all my fans for their support in these two years

真的很感谢有你们
Thank y’all very much for always being there

好的我的话说完了
That’s all I want to say

拜拜
Bye
