哈咯大家好
Hello everyone

我兄弟送我的竹鼠
My buddy sent me two bamboo rats

已經吃了一個了
We've already eaten one 

上一個做的是竹筍燒竹鼠
Last time we did Braised Bamboo Rat with Bamboo Shoot

我伯父也吃了
My uncle had some too

味道怎么样四伯爷
Uncle, how'd it taste?

味道可好了,好得很,吃起很鲜
It tasted great, very great, very tasty

很鲜吧
Very tasty right?

嗯
Yea

这个竹鼠放在家里连铁笼子都咬烂了
Over the past few days here, this rat has already gnawed up the metal cage.

很厉害
Very impressive

然后这段时间喂它吃竹子
So during this time we fed it bamboo

还有喂它吃米饭
And fed it rice

还有苹果他也吃
And even apples, it eats all

我感觉他也并不是说只吃竹子
I personally feel it is not bamboo-exclusive.

它咬这个铁笼子估计是在磨牙
It is gnawing on the cage to sharpen its teeth.

四伯爷想怎么弄来吃
Uncle, how should we prep it this time?

好是像上次那样烧来吃撒
How about like last time, braised?

上次吃起来还好吃
Last time was pretty good

烧来吃吗
Braised hm?

看是烧来吃还是烤来吃
Let's see if we're gonna braise it or grill it

随便怎么弄来吃都安逸
No matter how it's done, it'll come out great

有粉丝说弄来整刺身
Some fans said let's make sashimi

整什么
Make what

刺身
Sashimi

我没听说过
I've never heard of it

他想逃,你看嘛
It's trying to run away, check it out

它还想逃跑
He's still trying to run

嗯
Yeah

它没有伴
It has no friends

这个竹鼠肯定是有点郁闷了
This bamboo rat is probably a little depressed

它没有伴就想逃铁丝笼, 笼都咬烂了
Doesn't have any friends so it wants to escape from the cage, it's been gnawed through

我兄弟说这样子可是不行的
My buddy said this isn't good for the rat

我们干脆把它烤了吧
Let's just grill it

那这样就烧点水嘛
So, let's get some water boiling

好好好
Ok ok ok

四伯爷
Uncle...

你先烧起火我去拿点碳过来生
Get the fire started, I'll go get some charcoal

要得要得, 你搞快点嘛, 现在有火才好好生得燃
Alright alright, hurry it up, there's some embers so it'll start quickly

等会二火熄了生不燃
If the fire extinguishes we'll have trouble starting it again

四伯爷,碳来了
Uncle, here's the coal

你提的啥子哦
What are you carrying

碳都嘛
Charcoal

碳嘛
Charcoal...

拿刀来割一下
Cut it with a knife

你割开看一下是什么碳
Cut it open, take a look at the type of coal

这种黑炭
This kind of black coal

噢哟
Aiyo

这次用得完啊
Are we going to use it all this time around

下次可以烤其他的呀
Well next time we can use it to grill something else

烤鱼那些
Grilled fish etc

烤鱼烤鸡
Grilled fish grilled chicken

烤鸭子
Grilled duck

可以吧
Is it alright

可以
Yeah

多放点进去
Add some more

四伯爷火烧熄了呀
Uncle, the fire's going out

不急不急慢慢来
Don't rush, don't rush, slowly

好嘛
Alright

你烧斗, 我去看一下竹鼠怎么样了
You get the fire going, I'll go see how the rat is doing

要得
Alright

马上就来火了
Fire's gonna be ready soon

伊啊
Yee ah

现在我伯爷在烧水
My uncle's heating up the water right now

把这个竹鼠放出来一会儿
Let's let the rat out for a bit

关了几天了
Locked up for a few days

可能真的会郁闷
It probably is actually depressed

真的会忧郁
Actual depression

就像我兄弟说的一样
Like my buddy said

而且今天特别热
Today's particularly hot

怕他中暑
Don't want it to get a heat stroke

不过已经不重要了
But that's not important anymore

来,出来
Come, come out

然后,这个,宰杀就不跟大家分享了
And... so... we won't share the slaughtering process

想要知道它是怎么做的话
If you would like to see the technique

可以去关注一下我前2个视频
Please take a look at the 2 previously uploaded videos

竹笋烧竹鼠里面就有宰杀这一步
The Braised Bamboo Rat with Bamboo Shoot video shows the slaughtering steps

四伯爷过来帮忙都拉一下
Uncle, lend me a hand

嘿
Heh

嘿
Heh

嘿
Heh

嘿
Heh

好
Done

砍根竹子来做十字架
Chopped down a bamboo stalk to make a wooden cross

差不多了
Just about done

吓我一跳
Scared me

这个火还不能太大了
Don't want to make the fire too strong

四伯爷这个你还烧得多安逸
Uncle, you seared it perfectly

嘿嘿
Hehe

金黄金黄的
Golden brown, golden brown

其实长久以来我兄弟做的竹鼠
Actually, for a while now, when my buddy is cooking bamboo rat

烤竹鼠
Grilling bamboo rat

有的地方做得不是很合理
Some techniques don't seem to fit

现在我是想通过这个视频
Today I would like to share via this video

大家相互一起学习一下
For everyone to learn from each other

兄弟你看得到这个视频吗
Buddy you see this video?

等会儿我们试试这个竹鼠
Later we'll try this bamboo rat

看看味道怎么样
See how it tastes

如果好吃的话我就带你去我兄弟家吃
If it tastes good, I'll take you to my buddy's house and get some

哪个兄弟哦
Which buddy?

就是江西赣州那个兄弟
The buddy that lives in Ganzhou, Jiangxi

他那里竹鼠养得多,下次去找他
He's got lots of bamboo rats there, next time we'll go visit him

杀几个来干(吃)呀
Take a few to eat

嗯, 杀几个来干(吃)
Yeah, take a few to eat

喊他多杀几个
Tell him to take some more

兄弟家的就是我家的
What's my buddy's is also mine

我家的还是我们自己的
What's mine is also mine

嗯
Yeah

好
Ok

要的嘛下次去叫他多杀几个来干(吃)
If we want, next time we'll ask him to take a few extra for us to eat

把水倒了
Pour out the water

然后这个里面要划一下
Cut a few slices here

因为如果不划的话就不入味
If you don't slice it, the flavor won't be absorbed

腌的时候不入味
The marinade won't be absorbed

用这个尖刀在肋骨这里划进去
Use a sharp knife to add a few cuts along the rib cage

我兄弟只会放姜葱料酒
My buddy only uses ginger, scallions, and cooking wine

还有老抽
And dark soy sauce

其实在放点这个蚝油也不错
Actually adding some oyster sauce is also pretty good

加一点老抽
Add some dark soy sauce

老抽是上颜色的, 少放一点
Don't add too much dark soy sauce, it's just for color

然后这个生抽
Now this light soy sauce

然后这个姜葱一起把他捏碎
Then add ginger and garlic and crush them together

再放一点这个料酒
Then add the cooking wine

好就这样腌40分钟吧
Alright, marinate for 40 minutes.

其实我兄弟每次做这个竹鼠火都烧的很旺
So when my buddy cooks the bamboo rat, he always has these huge blazing fires.

烧烤不能见到明火
When grilling, you don't want to see the actual flames

见到明火就不叫做烤
If you see the flame, then it's not grilling

叫做烧
It's searing

兄弟你知道了吗
Buddy now you know!

下次...
Next time...

我现在先把这个烧烤练熟透
Let me practice this grilling technique first

因为我之前没考过竹鼠
Becuase I've never grilled bamboo rat before

等我练好了之后过来用你的烧烤来试一下手
After I've practiced it, I'll come use your grill and give it a shot

顺便我也做给你吃
And grill it for you to eat

这个脸跟猪脸一样
This face looks like the face of a pig

就是啊
Yeah

这是它的耳朵
This is the ear

是耳朵呀
An ear?

你还没有去江西耍过哦 (没去)
So you've never been to Jiangxi (No)

下次带你去
I'll take you next time

用刀划一下
Use a knife and cut a line here

这个皮子很脆哦
The skin is very crispy

这个皮子还有点切不动
The skin is a bit difficult to cut through

感觉这个皮子已经有一点脆了
Feels like this skin is already getting pretty crispy

我们在中间划开
We'll cut some lines down the center

就是不要划它边上
Just don't cut the edges

划边上怕他烂
Cutting the edges might cause it to fall apart

特别就是这个脸
Especially on the face

连这个位置特别厚
This area is particularly thick

也不知道他是不是他脸皮很厚
Maybe it's got thick skin (joke) 

刚才摸了一点蜂蜜
Brushed some honey on there

他这个烤出来的颜色特别好看
So color after grilling will look even better

哇
Wow

嘿呀,好安逸哦,看起来黄双双
Hey, it's so great!  Look at the browning

现在我们这个竹鼠烤好的话因该天要黑完了
It will probably be past sunset when we're done grilling

烤烧烤就是要在这个时候烤
Grilling is best done around this time

上午的话可能起不来那么早
In the morning... probably won't get up early enough

晚上的话烤起来也很凉快
The weather is also cooler during night grilling

等一下再下(喝)一瓶啤酒
Later let's have a beer

这种感觉就很爽
These types of feelings are the best

好香啊
Smells so good

你看这个油
See the oil here

哇,冒得太厉害了
Wow, there's so much coming out

其实这不是我刷的油,是它皮下的那层油
This isn't the oil I brushed on, it's the oil from underneath the skin

沺沺
Tian Tian!

嗯
Ya?

竹鼠快要好了哟
Bamboo rat's almost ready!

好脆哟
So crispy

有盐味没得
Does it have salt

有盐味
It's got salt

就是要有盐味, 不是不得行
Gotta have salt, can't not have it

大家可以看一下这个是很脆的
Everbody take a look at the crispiness

这个皮很爽
The skin is great

很脆
Very crispy

刚刚我吃了一点
I tried a bit just now

嘎嘣嘎嘣的响跟锅巴一样
"Ga bong ga bong" like scorched rice

要不要起来看看
Wanna take a look?

我抱你好不好
I'll hold you ok?

妈妈抱你来看一下
Mama will hold you so you can see

好香
Smells so good

快好了, 现在刷点有油撒点料就可以上了
It's almost ready, let's brush on some oil and seasoning and it'll be ready to eat

哇好香好香
Wow, it smells so good, so good!

好多烟
So much smoke

是有点烟
There's a bit of smoke

现在撒一点这个孜然粉
Let's add some of this cumin powder

把他涂均匀一点
Brush it evenly around on top

现在最后在撒一点花椒(面)
At the end, add some ground Sichuan pepper

还有辣椒
And spicy red pepper flakes

我不要吃花椒
I don't want to eat Sichuan pepper

我留一半不撒
I'll keep half of it pepper-free

给你吃个腿腿够不够
Is a piece of thigh enough fo you?

只有腿腿不够吃
A thigh is not enough!

那还要吃一点肉肉对不对
Have to eat some meat as well, right?

嗯
Yeah

嗯好
Yeah, OK.

爸爸弄得好香啊
Daddy made it smell so good

我留一个地方不撒辣椒
I'll keep a pepper-free section

好不好
Ok?

好,在撒一点辣椒面
Ok, add some red pepper flakes

辣椒面我不要吃
I don't want to eat red pepper flakes

哇, 不错不错
Wow, not bad not bad

搞辣一点
Make it spicier

好,最后撒一点芝麻
Ok, finally add some sesame seeds

芝麻
Sesame seeds

对
yeah

我兄弟每次都没有撒芝麻
My buddy never adds sesame

下次去他们那里给他建议一下
Next time we visit, I'll give him the suggestion

这样更香嘛,是不是
That way it smells even better, right?

好啦
Alright

我们要准备吃饭哟
We're going to prepare dinner

好爽啊
Feels great!

看到吗
See it?

四伯爷, 你看
Uncle, take a look

嘿嘿嘿
Hehehe

这个芝麻撒上就太美观了
Adding sesame made it look absolutely gorgeous

太诱人了
Too enticing

嗯
Yea

还有没有啤酒哦
Do we have any more beer

有一瓶, 喊你爸爸去买
Just 1 bottle. Tell your dad to go buy some

嗯
Yeah

二娃
Son!

去喊你五爹买啤酒
Tell your uncle to go buy some beer

多买两瓶
Buy a couple bottles
