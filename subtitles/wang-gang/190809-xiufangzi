Hello大家好，我们的房子已经修的差不多了
Hello everyone, the construction is almost finished 

昨天前天修了灶还有这个院子
We spent the last two days on constructing the stove and this courtyard

现在已经可以在上面踩了
Now you can already set foot on the concrete floor

我带大家看下我家房子里面怎么样
Let me show you how it is inside 

1:这屋子怎么这么暗呀？
Why is the room so dark?

亮瓦装的不够
We haven't put enough “bright tiles” (translucent tile)
\*https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BA%AE%E7%93%A6*\

还有就是那窝竹子把这里遮了
And then that patch of bamboos cast a shadow over the house

啊，要多装亮瓦把竹子砍了
Ayo, gotta put on more bright tiles and remove the bamboos

才够亮
To lighten up the room

1:但是这边还阔以啊
But this side is actually bright?

1:我看一下客厅
Let me check the living room

客厅的门大点嘛
That’s because the door is wider 

1:客厅还不是黢黑的啊
The living room is also a bit dark, is it?

客厅不算黑
Living room is not too dark

我拉一下看看
Let me try dragging it

1:拉不动，不要拉
It won’t move, don’t drag it!

好，阔以咯
OK, it’s alright 

里面卡起的不好整哦
It's stuck inside. It's too hard 

你要看上面
Look above！

注意不要碰到瓦了
Don’t let it scratch the tiles

1:看见没，这就是效果
Check it out!

弄开瞬间就亮了
It immediately turns brighter after the removal 

1:小心小心
Be careful!

哎哟哟
ahhh

1:倒就倒下去咯
Let it fall if you can’t handle it 

嘿嘿嘿
Hahahah 

1:注意碰到瓦哈
Watch out it might scratch the tiles 

欸，不得行，不得行
It doesn't seem a lot, but it's actually pretty dense 

上面勾起的
It’s tangled on the top

把颠颠甩过去
Swing the tips to the other side 

不要拉
No pulling!

把这根颠颠甩过去
Just swing this beam up!

1:搅起的
Got stuck together...

好，让开让开
Yeah, move!

好，阔以咯
Okay, solved 

1:今天我们现在这个竹子砍的差不多了
We’ve cut about enough bamboos today 

1:但是还是砍的不够
Still not enough though

1:这边大概砍了二吨
We cut around two tons of bamboo over there

1:看起来这里不多但密度非常大
It doesn't look like a lot but it is nevertheless pretty dense 

1:我以为砍竹子是很轻松的活儿
I thought cutting bamboos would be an easy task

1:我的手在茧子上面都起了泡
Blisters even raise on the callus of my hands 

1:但是一点都不痛
Fortunately it doesn't hurt me at all 

1:这个竹子吧，豁人（割人）
These bamboo leaves are really sharp

1:今天这个竹子砍了是不是要好多了？
Isn’t it much better after we cut down the bamboos today?

嗯，是要亮多了，但还是要加亮瓦
Right, much brighter, still needs bright tiles though

1:亮瓦还是不够嘎？
We still need more bright tiles?

嗯
Yeah

1:这边客厅呢？
How about the living room?

客厅就不加亮瓦了
The living room does not need bright tile

客厅够亮咯
It’s quite bright already 

1:客厅都没有亮瓦
There’s no bright tiles installed in the room

谁给你说客厅要加亮瓦哟
Who told you to have bright tiles in the living room?

客厅不装亮瓦的
We simply don’t do that

1:这边呢？
How about this room?

这边再装几块亮瓦就可以了
Just add a couple on the roof and we’ll be all set

1:好，要得
Good.
