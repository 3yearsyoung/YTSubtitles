哈嘍大家好我是王剛
Hello everyone I am Wang Gang

前几天我跟拐哥打野约了一下
I made plans with "Guai Ge" (Ge = honorific) a couple days ago

我们一起去看看他怎么弄马蜂窝
We're going to see how he removes a hornet nest

这个马蜂窝在树上也是挺危险的
The hornet nests in the trees are pretty dangerous

这是怕伤到别的人
We're gonna remove it to avoid hurting other people

然后这边的村民跟拐哥联系好了
Guai Ge has spoken with the local villagers

我们去看一下
Let's go and take a look

我这是第一次光明正大的弄
This is the first time I've actually done this 

以前弄过一次
I've tried this before

以前（小时候）用石头扔它扔了就跑
When I was a kid, I threw a rock at it, and ran

跑的时候他蛰了一下我的手
While running, they still stung me.

当时我的手肿这么大
At the time my hand swelled this big.

又红又肿又痛那种感觉你知道吗
It was red, swollen, and painful, have you ever had that feeling?

所以你看拐哥他们这个很专业还有防峰服
So take a look at Guai Ge; they are very professional, they even have beekeeping suits.

等一下你就穿这套
You'll put this one on later

穿上这个还能蛰到人吗
Can they still sting me if I wear this

蛰不到人这个穿上稳当得很
They can't sting you, this is very safe

刚哥戴不戴眼镜的
Does "Gang Ge" need safety glasses?

他不用他就在下面用不上
He won't need them, he'll be inside the suit, won't need them

这个有点像太空服哦
This kinda looks like a spacesuit

拐哥我帮你做点什么？
Guai Ge, what can I help with?

你就帮我扶梯子
You can help me with the ladder

我把它取下来后会用绳子放下来
After I detach the nest (from the tree), we'll let it down with rope.

你在下面帮我打下手
And you can help me bring it down

要的要的 好的
Okay

你看我现在就像那个超人一样
Look at me, I'm like superman

嘿嘿嘿
Hehehe

这蜂子好像睡槕了
The hornets look like their asleep

现在拐哥已经上去了
Guai Ge has climbed up already

拐哥爬树果然是厉害
He's really good at climbing trees

就这样都能够爬上去
Climbed up just like that

要是换做常人真的不敢想象
Couldn't imagine a normal person doing it

然后我现在穿的这个
So I'm wearing this outfit

很安全很安全
It's very safe, very safe

不过就是很热
But very hot as well

拐哥注意安全哦
Guai Ge, watch out!

好的
Ookay

我下来了你走楼梯上来给我接一下嘛
I'm coming down, you come up the ladder and give me a hand.

没得问题你大胆爬就是
Just go, don't be afraid 

来嘛
Come on

放嘛
Let it go

你注意到哈
Watch out

拿只手边扶梯子边下去
Hold on to the ladder with your other hand as you're going down

你下去嘛
Go down

好
Sure

抓到了
Got it

这么大一个
This one is really big

那个马蜂嗡嗡的响
They're making buzzing noises

很厉害
Very impressive

第一次这么抓蜂窝虽然不是我亲自把它弄下来的
This is the first time I've captured a hornet nest like this, though I didn't personally do it!

但是感觉非常刺激
But it's still very exciting

你可以看一下这里面
You can see

蜂蛹还在动
pupae that are still moving

非常厉害
Very cool

里面还有蜂子
There are still a few hornets inside

那边的农家里面还有一个比这个更大
There's an even larger nest in that farmer's house

但是那个更矮一点
But it's not as high up

没有这个这么高
Not as high as this one

虽然说矮一点但是那个马蜂野性非常强的
Though it's lower, that wasp nest is very aggressive

那个应该危险更大挑战性更高
So it should be more dangerous and more difficult

一会儿拐哥带我去
Guai Ge will take me there later

看一下怎么收拾它
To see how we'll deal with it

走 我们去上面休息一下
Go, let's go take a break

把马蜂服摘下透下气
Take the beesuit off and ventilate

慢一点
Slow down

走这边吧
This way

跟着我走
Follow me

这个是蜂王吗
Is this the hornet queen?

这个不是蜂王
No it isn't

里面有两个职蜂
There are 2 drone hornets

小心手哦不是要蛰到你
Be careful, don't get stung

这一板全部在动
This whole section is still moving

这个是不是叫黄蜂
Are these called yellow hornet?

对我们叫的黄屁股
Yeah, we call them "yellow butts"

那边那个叫黑屁股黑尾
The one over there we call "black butt" "black tails"

这叫黄尾
This is called a yellow tail

黑的更毒吧
Black ones are more venomous

黑的在我们这边应该是一种杂交品种
The black ones are a hybridized species

在我们这边是最毒的一种？
They're the most venomous species here

我们现在去下一个
Now let's go to the next site

下一个地方叫什么
What's the next place called

下一个蜂窝是在核桃树上面
The next hornet nest is on top of a walnut tree

就是结果果的树上面
On top of a fruited tree

不高
Not tall

但是那个蜂窝有这么大
But the hornet nest is this big

就是黑蜂嘛
They're black hornets

我跟你讲
Let me tell you

这个蜂都不是很严重
The hornets aren't really that bad

等一下你去体验一下
You'll see it ina  bit

上树前补充水分
Hydrate before you climb up the tree

现在我们在穿防蜂服
Now let's put on the beesuit

跟拐哥一起去弄第二个 黑蜂
And follow Guai Ge to handle the 2nd nest, the black hornet

黑马蜂
The Black Hornet

这个马蜂毒性超级强
This black hornet is super venomous

拐哥上次被蛰了一下那个脸肿的跟冬瓜一样
Guai Ge got stung last time, his face swelled up to the size of a winter melon

所以我有点怕只能把这个穿好
So I'm a little scared that the only thing I can do is make sure my suit is secure

注意这里有一个茅厕哈
Watch out there's a toilet here

跟热带雨林一样
(This) is just like a rainforest

逮到树子
Grab the tree

这个蜂子都来啦
The hornets are coming

小心点
Be careful!

你带了眼镜的吧
You're wearing glasses?

戴了的
Wearing them

我的妈呀 这个蜂子不得了哦
Holy moly these hornets are crazy

好吓人啊 好吓人啊
Super scary super scary

大家千万不要模仿这个东西
Everybody please do not copy what we're doing

非常非常的危险
Super super dangerous

据拐哥说前段时间有个老人
Guai Ge told us there was an elderly person

爬到树上面去打核桃惊动了这个蜂子
Climbed up a tree to harvest walnuts, accidentally scared the hornets

有几个蜂子咬了他几下
A few of them bit him a couple times

咬(蛰)了几下从树上摔下去就(死了)
Bit (stung) him a few times and he fell off the tree (and died)

哇这个马蜂好厉害啊
Wow these hornets are crazy

看到没
See that

就在我这里飞来飞去的
Just flying in circles around me

我好像抓到一个
I think I caught one

唉呦 跑掉啦
Aiyo, it ran away

拐哥慢点哦
Guai Ge, slow down

没事
I'm good

那个树枝是朽的
That branch is rotten

唉呦
Aiyo

大家千万不要模仿
Everyone do not copy what we're doing!

又来了 (this is not in the original video subtitle)
They're coming again

拐哥包里都装的啥呦 (this is not spoken in the video)
Guai Ge has a bunch of stuff in his bag

别看爬得这么容易
Though our climb looked easy

我告诉你
Let me tell you

爬树很厉害的人来爬这个都不一定很行
Even those who are tree climbing pros might not be able to climb this tree

因为还要穿着这个防蜂服
Because you have to wear this beekeeping suit

而且现在是非常热
And it's very hot

你看这个马蜂就在我面前飞呀飞
You can see the hornets flying around my face

嗡嗡嗡的
Buzzing

锯子,剪子,绳子,袋子
Saw, scissors, rope, bag

开始咯
Let's start

不要慌 我还没整好
Don't rush, I'm not ready

慢点啊 刚哥
Slow down, Gang Ge

嗯
Okay

主要是拉一下 避免朝房子那边倒
Basically pull it gently, avoid tilting/spilling it towards the house

开始咯
Let's go

刚哥你让开一点 小心绳子绊倒你
Gang Ge, step back a bit, don't get entangled

这个毒投在鼻子里面都要打喷嚏吗
This poison (spray) once it hits your nose do you always sneez?

对 这个鼻子敏感得很
Yeah, this is very sensitive to the nose

唉呦
Aiyo

跟钻那个啥一样
Like crawling through that thing

唉呦
Aiyo

中招了
I'm hit!

那个蜂毒投到我这里来了
That anti-wasp spray has spread over here

这个蜂窝太大了
This hornet's nest is too big

这个袋子套不进去
The bag doesn't fit

拐哥是不是从小就会爬树哦
Guai Ge, were you a really good climber as a kid?

读书的时候就是成绩不好爬树厉害
During my studies, my grades were bad, my climbing skills were great

哇 终于来了
Wow, finally

这个真的有点重
This is actually kind of heavy

你们退一下我清理一下战场
You all back up a bit, let me clean up the warzone

因为这个地方不清理
If we don't clean it up

怕的是农民从这里过
I'm afraid when farmers walk through here

逮这个树枝
Accidentally grab this branch

还有余留的马蜂
The remaining hornets

它就会去蛰他们
Will go and sting them

我要把它清理一下你们先退一下
I'm going to clean it up, you all back up for now

辛苦了拐哥
Thank you for the effort, Guai Ge

没事儿
No problem

哇这个真的是
Wow this really is

我都还没干啥全身都湿透
I didn't even do anything and I'm covered in sweat

先喝水
First hydrate

慢点喝
Drink slower

这一瓶还解决不了我跟你说
This one bottle isn't enough, I'll tell you what

这个手都泡白了
My fingers have soaked white

我协助拐哥一起弄了2个
I helped Guai Ge handle 2

一大一小
A big one and a small one

这个有10-20斤
This one is about 10-20 jin (5-10 kg)

这个有6-7斤把
This one is about 6-7 jin (3.5-4 kg)

这个有好几斤
This has to be a few jin

主要是什么呢
The primary reason then,

这附近是村庄
Nearby is a village

除害了
Removing threats

为民除害
Removing threats for the populace

因为太多老人和小孩
Too many elderly and children

稍不注意就会被马蜂蛰
If not carefull, will be stung by the hornets

后面我会用这个跟大家分享一个美食
