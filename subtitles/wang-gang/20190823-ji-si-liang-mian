哈喽大家好我是王刚
Hello everyone this is Wang Gang

本期视频为大家带来一道家常菜
In this video, I'll introduce a homestyle dish

鸡丝凉面
Ji-si-liang-mian

首先我们准备土鸡半只
First we prepare half a local chicken

没有土鸡的同学可以用肉鸡代替
Who don't have local chicken can use Broiler instead

最好选择老鸡因为鸡越老鸡肉就越香
You'd better use old chicken because the older the chicken the more fragrant it is.

或者也可以直接在超市购买鸡脯肉
Or you can buy chicken breast directly from the supermarket

然后再将鸡腿肉取下
Then remove the meat from the chicken leg

鸡腿肉取下之后必须将鸡皮扯下来
The skin of the chicken has to be pulled off after the leg is removed

将鸡脯肉和鸡腿轻轻拍打几下之后下一步开始准备辅料
Pat the breast and leg lightly a few times and then prepare the others

准备生姜1小块拍散切成小块备用
Prepare 1 small piece of ginger and cut into small pieces

准备大葱1根拍散之后切成小段备用
Prepare 1 small piece of spring onion and cut into small pieces

下一步我们开始处理鸡肉
Nexy we should deal with chicken

首先我们在锅中加入适量的清水
First we add some water into pot

然后将鸡肉冷水下锅
Then put chicken into cold water in the pot

再加入准备好的姜葱
Add the prepared ginger and spring onions

锅中加入适量的料酒将鸡肉煮10分钟
Add some cooking wine and cook the chicken for 10 minutes

这一步的目的是将鸡肉煮至熟透方便扯丝
The purpose of this step is to cook the chicken until it is well cooked and ready to be torn

中途再撇去浮末
Then skim off the floating

10分钟之后将煮熟的鸡肉倒出冷却备用
Remove the cooked chicken and set aside after 10 minutes

下一步开始准备辅料和面条
The next step is to prepare the trimmings and noodles

准备青瓜2小段切成细丝备用
Cut cucumber into 2 sticks and set aside

同学们也可以用绿豆芽焯水后做辅料
Students can also use mung bean sprouts to blanch them as trimmings

青瓜丝切好之后放入盘中备用
Shred cucumber and put it on a plate

准备胡萝卜1小块切成细丝备用
Prepare small pieces of carrot and cut them into thin shreds.

同学们最好尽可能的切细一些
Students had better cut them as thin as possible.

这样更美观口感更爽脆
It's more beautiful and crisp.

最后再准备大葱一根
Finally, prepare one of the spring onions

从中间划开之后切成葱丝备用
Cut into shredded onions after slicing in the middle.

嫌麻烦的同学可以直接用小葱切成段即可
Students who are disgusted with trouble can cut the scallions into sections directly.

然后将三丝按照各自喜好摆入盘中
Then put the three shreds on the plate according to their preferences.

摆盘这一步可以完全按照喜好来不受限制
The sabot step can be completely unrestricted according to preferences.

下一步开始调料汁
Next step we start making condiment juice

首先我们在碗中加入花生酱15克
First, we add 15 grams of peanut butter to the bowl.

加入生抽酱油12克
Add 12 grams of soy sauce

加入晒醋3克（香醋陈醋都可以）
Add 3 grams of Shai vinegar(Fregrant vinegar or old vinegar can be used)

加入花椒油3克
Add 3 grams of pepper oil

加入青花椒面1小半勺
Add 1/2 teaspoon of green pepper noodles

然后加入纯净水15克
Then add 15 grams of pure water.

加入纯净水之后将碗中的料汁搅拌均匀
Mix the sauce in the bowl evenly after adding pure water.

然后准备几颗大蒜剁成蒜蓉放入碗中
Then prepare several pieces of garlic chopped into garlic paste and put them in a bowl.

碗中再加入1勺白糖
Add 1 teaspoon sugar to the bowl

最后按照个人口味加入适量的香辣红油拌匀即可
Finally, add some spicy red oil according to personal taste and mix well.

鸡肉凉透之后将其撕成细丝备用
Cool the chicken thoroughly and tear it into shreds.

个人建议也可以用鸡腿制作
It can also be made with chicken legs

其实鸡腿的香味不必鸡胸肉差
Actually, the aroma of chicken leg is not worse than that of chicken breast.

下一步我开始处理面条
Next step we should deal with noodles

首先我们在锅中加入适量的清水
First, we add some water to the pot.

然后开大火烧开
Then open big fire to boil it

大火烧开之后加入准备好的碱水面下锅
After the fire is boiled, add the prepared alkali water noodles to the pot.

碱水面下锅之后待其再次水开10秒钟即可倒出冷却
After alkali water noodles were put into pot you can pour out and cooling it when water has been boiled for 10s

因为碱水面不能久煮否则口感不够爽滑
Because the alkali water noodles can't be boiled for a long time or the taste is not smooth enough.

面条捞出之后加入少许的菜籽油拌匀
Mix the noodles with a little rapeseed oil.

冷却的过程中也可以用风扇或者物理降温
Fans or physical cooling can also be used during cooling.

一切都是追求美食生活的极致
Everything is the ultimate pursuit of gourmet life

比较懒的同学可以忽略
A little lazier students can ignore this step.

面条冷却之后将其盘起来放入盘中
Cool the noodles and put them on a plate.

同样懒的同学可以忽略
The same is lazier students can ignore it

然后加入撕好的鸡丝
Then add the shredded chicken.

将调好的料汁再次拌匀淋在面条上面即可
Mix the sauce well again and sprinkle it on the noodles.

淋好料汁后再放上一些香菜
Put some coriander on it after pouring source

一道清新脱俗的美味鸡丝凉面就制作完成
A fresh and delicate chicken shredded cold noodle is made.

下面开始技术总结

第一，鸡肉选老不选嫩，鸡腿也可以制作
First, chicken should be old rather than tender.It also can be made by chicken legs

第二，配菜辅料可以依据各自喜好添加
Second, vegetable accessories can be added according to their preferences.

第三，面条下锅不能久煮否则口感尽失
Thirdly, noodles should not be cooked for a long time or they will lose their taste.

第四，料汁的比例也可以根据地区微调

第五，勤快的同学完全可以放手一试美味就在你的面前
