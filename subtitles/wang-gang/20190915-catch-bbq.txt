#现在我们一大帮人去他（华农）兄弟家抓鱼
Now the whole group of us are going to catch fish at our buddies' (Huanong Brothers) place.

0:00:07.660,0:00:12.980
#有四伯、苏良兄还有他的一些兄弟
Here are my uncle, Suliang (Huanong) and some of his buddies we well.

0:00:13.540,0:00:18.380
#等下抓回来的时候让这位大厨弄点给我们吃一下
After catching the fish, we are going to have this Chef to serve us a feast.

0:00:18.640,0:00:19.920
#那必须的
Sure! My pleasure.

0:00:20.560,0:00:22.400
#但是我弄的都很辣哦
But I am going to make it very spicy.

0:00:22.400,0:00:25.740
#没事我挺能吃辣的
No worries. I can eat rather spicy food.

0:00:25.820,0:00:31.040
#现在慢慢都吃辣椒了以前都不吃的
I didn't eat too much chili before, but now I am getting used to it.

0:00:32.120,0:00:36.300
#我兄弟带我来他们家自己的鱼塘里面
My buddy is taking me to their own pond.

0:00:37.560,0:00:39.340
#把水放干了好抓鱼
We'll be draining away the water first so that it becomes easier to catch the fish.

0:00:39.880,0:00:43.500
#他说人太多了不好（意思）去祸害别的兄弟
He said that he is not going to loot other buddies when so many people are around.

0:00:43.600,0:00:49.420
#那就只能现在在他们鱼塘里面把水放干了抓点鱼
So he has no choice but draining his own pond so that we can catch some fish.

0:00:53.080,0:00:54.420
#你们家狗也来了
Your dogs are coming too.

0:01:04.280,0:01:06.460
#你这里都放了些什么鱼呢
What fish have you put in here?

0:01:06.500,0:01:07.540
#蛇头鱼
Snakehead fish

0:01:08.520,0:01:10.160
#就是那个黑鱼（生鱼）
I mean the black fish (sheng yu).

0:01:11.740,0:01:13.380
#有些叫生鱼有些叫黑鱼
It's sometimes called "sheng yu" or "black fish" at other time.

0:01:14.240,0:01:15.680
#估计都只剩下黑鱼了
I think only the black fish remain.

0:01:16.240,0:01:20.340
#我放了好多小鱼下去肯定被蛇头鱼吃掉了
I have put a lot of small fish but I am sure that the snakehead fish have eaten them all,

0:01:22.060,0:01:23.060
#因为（黑鱼）吃肉的
as the back fish are carnivores.

0:01:24.540,0:01:26.520
#黄鳝泥鳅都放了好多下去
I have put a lot of eel and loach.

0:01:26.540,0:01:29.740

I thought that the ponds here were very large,

0:01:30.080,0:01:33.100
#就是很深的那种
I mean, the very deep ones.

0:01:33.880,0:01:35.500
#我们都自家的小鱼塘
Ours are always home-made little ponds.

0:01:36.100,0:01:39.020
#随便堵起一个来就是一个鱼塘
A pond can be formed by simply blocking the water.

0:01:39.020,0:01:40.800
#这水从山上流下来
The water is from the hill, isn't it?

0:01:40.800,0:01:42.540
#对 很冰的 这是山泉水
Yea! It's really cool. This is spring water.

0:01:43.800,0:01:45.740
#跟我们那边的井水差不多
It's quite similar to our well water.

0:01:47.860,0:01:49.680
#看到有鱼了 看到了
You can see the fish now.
Yea, yea I can see them.

0:01:59.880,0:02:00.900
#好乖啊你
You're a very good dog.

0:02:25.060,0:02:25.980
#深不深
Is it deep?

0:02:29.620,0:02:30.560
#还好
It's not too bad.

0:02:31.260,0:02:32.440
#中间有点深
It's quite deep in the middle.

0:02:43.240,0:02:44.460

The fish are all on that side!

Gotcha again!

0:04:02.080,0:04:02.820

Yea, perhaps.

0:04:04.320,0:04:05.320

#有五六斤
5 to 6 jin (1jin = 500 grams) of fish.

0:04:31.340,0:04:32.380
#有五六斤啊
Is it that much?

0:04:32.380,0:04:33.540
#真的有五六斤
Yeah! Really

0:04:35.640,0:04:37.700
#这个我们叫生鱼 我们叫蛇头鱼
We call this fish "sheng yu".
And we call it snakehead fish.

0:04:37.700,0:04:38.540
#好瘦啊
It's very skinny.

0:04:38.540,0:04:39.700

This fish is tasty.

0:04:40.180,0:04:41.140

This fish is very skinny.

0:04:42.040,0:04:42.960
#你脚那里还有一条
There's one more fish next to your foot.

0:04:43.380,0:04:44.900
#能活不能活呐
Can it survive?

0:04:45.480,0:04:49.500
#哟哟哟又把它抓回来了
Yo yo yo! I catch it back again.

0:04:51.960,0:04:53.760
#可以活的把它放回去
Yes, it can. Let's release it.

0:04:54.280,0:04:56.540
#这种小鱼不好吃的
This kind of small fish....tastes nothing!

0:04:58.020,0:05:00.740
#走啦走啦把鱼抱回去
Let's go, let's go. I'll take it back.

0:05:14.160,0:05:15.920
#兄弟带我弄了半天鱼
My buddy took me to catch the fish for a good whole day.

0:05:16.940,0:05:18.220
#都快闪到腰了
My waist is almost hurt.

0:05:19.820,0:05:22.815
#他答应了带我去打他们家的板栗
He has promised to knock their chestnuts with me.

0:05:22.820,0:05:24.660
#现在看一看有多少鱼
Let's see how much we have.

0:05:25.980,0:05:29.100
#这个全是在他们那个（鱼塘）里面弄的
These are all from their own pond.

0:05:29.780,0:05:32.080
#但是有几条大的被他放掉了
But he has released some of the larger ones.

0:05:33.160,0:05:34.680
#我怀疑我被他套路了
He must have set me up.

0:05:36.940,0:05:37.860
#不过没关系了
Well, never mind.

0:05:38.820,0:05:40.340
#等下我们去弄他家的板栗
We'll go to get their chestnuts.

0:05:49.940,0:05:53.320
#不对啊这不是弄来吃的吗
Isn't something wrong? Aren't we going to eat them?

0:05:53.340,0:05:54.740
#这都太小了不好吃
They are too small. They won't taste good.

0:05:54.940,0:05:57.560
#这不小了这鲫鱼刚刚好
No, it's not small. This "ji yu" is just right.

0:05:58.160,0:05:59.720
#还可以长很大的这个鲫鱼
This kind of fish can get very big.

0:05:59.720,0:06:01.220
#那我们今天不是白干啦
So what's the purpose of all our effort today?

0:06:01.220,0:06:03.580
#没事啊兄弟家有板栗我带你去摘
No worries. My buddy has chestnuts. You can pick some with me.

0:06:04.320,0:06:05.860
#很多板栗哦
He has a lot! Chestnuts!

0:06:05.860,0:06:08.720
#你确定 确定真的不骗你们
Are you sure?
Sure! Trust me! I won't fake you.

0:06:08.720,0:06:10.120
#白干了一天活
We have worked for a day for nothing.

0:06:10.840,0:06:12.500
#等一下板栗很多
No. We'll get a lot of chestnuts.

0:06:13.860,0:06:15.740
#晚上我们把板栗当饭吃
We can have chestnuts as our main dish at dinner time.

0:06:16.260,0:06:17.040
#真的假的
Are you serious?

0:06:17.040,0:06:17.680

Sure!

0:06:17.680,0:06:18.460
#吃不饱
Will I be starving for the whole night?

0:06:18.580,0:06:19.760
#可以板栗吃得饱
No! You'll be stuffed with chestnuts,

0:06:20.180,0:06:22.160
#吃不饱再带去兄弟家吃饭
or you can come to my buddy to have a feast.

0:06:26.260,0:06:29.820
#等一下要去你们圈里面抓2只竹鼠来
You are going to catch two bamboo rats from your shed, aren't you?

0:06:29.900,0:06:30.740
#可以 没问题
Sure! No problem.

0:06:30.800,0:06:31.520
#嗯
Good.

0:06:31.800,0:06:34.620
#其实竹鼠我已经吃过了我想吃那个猪
In fact, I have already tried bamboo rats. What I want is your pig.

0:06:34.620,0:06:38.660
#猪就等它长大一点现在太小了
They're too small now. Let's wait until they become bigger.

0:06:39.080,0:06:41.100
#肉很嫩不好吃要老一点才香
It doesn't taste good when the pork is too soft. More mature and chewy pork,

0:06:41.900,0:06:43.380
#才有嚼劲
is more tasty.

0:06:43.380,0:06:44.040
#好吧
Alright, trust you.

0:06:47.360,0:06:48.220

#别搞坏了
Don't break it.

0:06:51.480,0:06:53.020
#管他呢不是我家的
Never mind. It's not mine anyway.

0:06:53.020,0:06:55.460
#嘿嘿又不是你家的
He he. Did you say it's not yours?

0:06:56.700,0:06:58.820
#前进
March on!

#1斤多不到2斤
at least one jin, but less than 2.

0:07:43.520,0:07:45.680
#兄弟你又偷偷的吃什么哦
So man, what are you eating behind us again?

0:07:45.900,0:07:46.780

You want some?

0:07:47.960,0:07:48.660
#要
Sure!

0:07:50.800,0:07:53.660
#就在兄弟家池塘搞的
It's taken from my buddy's pond.

0:07:54.800,0:07:58.520

Wa! Isn't it marvellous that you have so many buddies?

Take one.

Is it eaten right away?

0:08:04.600,0:08:05.180
#不是
Nope!

0:08:05.460,0:08:07.420
#吃里面的肉要把它剥开
You need to peal it. The edible part is inside.

0:08:09.740,0:08:11.240
#这个肉就那么一丢丢
The edible part is really tiny.

0:08:11.240,0:08:12.560
#这个不是很熟的
It's still not ready.

0:08:12.820,0:08:14.440
#也被我拧下来啦
But I have still picked it.

0:08:16.380,0:08:19.620
#嗯 真的无色无味
Aha! It's really colourless and tasteless.

0:08:20.320,0:08:21.960
#就是那种甘甘甜甜的
It's like, savory sweet.

0:08:21.960,0:08:22.880
#嗯
Yea

0:08:28.360,0:08:29.940
#太阳差不多要下山了 走吧
Let's go! The sun is already going down.

0:08:29.940,0:08:30.440
#嗯
Yep

0:08:30.740,0:08:32.040
#看一下你的竹鼠
Let's have a look at your bamboo roots.

0:08:32.040,0:08:33.100
#烤竹鼠
Grill them.

Let's go!

#我这兄弟终于愿意弄竹鼠来给我吃了
Finally, my buddy is willing to let me have his bamboo rats.

0:08:42.640,0:08:44.140
#这3只竹鼠
These three bamboo rats...

0:08:44.580,0:08:46.360
#你看这个就是很不听话的
Look! This is very naughty.

0:08:46.360,0:08:47.640
#老是动来动去
It's restless.

0:08:48.080,0:08:49.900
#都是公竹鼠吗
They are all male, aren't they?

0:08:49.900,0:08:50.700
#全是公的
Yea, all are males.

0:08:50.700,0:08:52.980
#母的我不会杀的
The females are not for food

0:08:53.320,0:08:54.340
#要留着下崽
but for giving birth to new rats.

0:08:54.940,0:08:55.440
#好吧
Got it.

0:08:55.440,0:08:59.120
#上次你说你那里面都是母的没有公的
You said last time that you have only females and no more males.

0:08:59.120,0:09:00.660
#我现在的竹鼠啊
My ratio now,

0:09:00.660,0:09:03.160
#1个公的配7个母的
is one male to seven females.

0:09:03.520,0:09:05.100
#比例呀已经比成这样子啦
What a ratio!

0:09:05.100,0:09:08.400
#不能再向他们动手啦
I'll need to spare the males from now on.

0:09:08.400,0:09:11.280
#到时候就是1个公的配10个母的
Otherwise, each male will need to mate with 10 females.

0:09:12.700,0:09:13.760
#嗯 可以
Um, alright.

0:09:13.960,0:09:14.800
#开动
Let's get started.

0:09:30.600,0:09:31.640

It's ok.

0:09:52.740,0:09:53.820
#看我们这个
See what we have!

0:09:54.320,0:09:58.600
#我已经研究透了这个竹鼠要躲几刀才烤得够快
I have figured out how many times you need to chop the bamboo rats to shorten the grilling time.

0:09:58.640,0:10:00.380
#对 比较入味
Yep! And the seasoning can be better absorbed.

0:10:00.400,0:10:03.740
#照我们这个速度20分钟就可以吃了
With this pace, we need only another 20 minutes.

0:10:03.760,0:10:04.400
#快啦
Soon

0:10:23.200,0:10:23.840

I think it's done.

0:10:23.860,0:10:25.120

Everything's ready!

Come on! Let's start!

0:10:27.800,0:10:30.660
#这个鸡烤得皮都脆了
The chicken now has a crispy skin.

0:10:30.660,0:10:32.260
#现在我们的竹鼠和这个
Now our bamboo rats and the...

0:10:32.780,0:10:33.880
#好香啊
It smells good!

0:10:34.380,0:10:39.060
#虽然说冒了些大烟然后起了火
Though there has been too much smoke and then the flame was too strong.

0:10:39.080,0:10:40.100
#哎哟 你干嘛
Ouch! Are you alright?

0:10:40.100,0:10:41.160
#有点烫
