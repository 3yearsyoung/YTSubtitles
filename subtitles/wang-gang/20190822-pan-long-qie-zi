【美食作家王刚】盘龙茄子 - https://youtu.be/uLh3QMVr7og

哈喽大家好我是王刚
Hello everyone this is Wang Gang

本期视频我跟大家分享一道創新菜
In this video I will share with everyone a creative dish

盤龍茄子
"Panlong Qiezi" ("Coiled Dragon Eggplants")

首先我们准备嫩茄子2根
First prepare 2 tender eggplants

切掉茄子蒂之后开始改刀
After chopping off the root, prepare to slice

同学们最好选择比较嫩且直的茄子
I recommend using soft and straight eggplants

因為這樣更好切
because they're easier to slice.

首先我们用正刀切进茄子五分之三的深度
First we'll use vertical cuts at about a 60% depth

用刀尖顶着菜板刀刃与菜板的角度为45度
Point the tip of the cleaver at the cutting board as the cushion, forming a 45 degree angle with the blade

没有手感的同学可以在茄子下面垫上一双筷子
Friends lacking knife skills can use chopsticks as slicing buffers next to the eggplant 

防止切斷
to prevent totally slicing through.

正面切好之后再翻过来
After slicing one side, flip it over

用同样的方式再加上刀身与茄子倾斜成45度角
Using the same technique, turn the cleaver 45 degrees to the eggplant,

切进茄子七分之四的深度
And continue slicing at about a 57% depth

同样每一刀都必须保持一致
Just like before, each cut must be uniform

这样才能保证茄子本身不断且美观
which guarantees that the eggplant won't split and will look beautiful

茄子切好之后下一步开始准备辅料
After the slicing step, we will prepare the side ingredients (mise en place)

准备去皮的五花肉一块切成小粒备用
Prepare 1 chunk of pork belly by slicing it into small pieces for mise

分享一个小窍门
Here I will share a little secret

肉末用刀切碎的比剁碎的更香
Sliced meat is more aromatic than minced ground meat

准备红椒一小块切成小粒备用
Dice a red pepper for mise

加红椒的目的是增加菜品的色彩
Adding red pepper is to increase the vividness of the dish

准备大蒜几颗拍散之后剁碎备用
Crush and mince some garlic for mise

准备生姜1小块剁碎备用
Prepare 1 piece of ginger, after smashing mince for mise

温馨提示：此菜为宽油制作，舍不得的同学请谨慎观看
Gentle reminder: this is a "kuanyou" (lots of frying oil) dish, reluctant friends may carefully observe 

下一步开始制作
Next we begin the assembly

首先我们把锅烧热
First we will get the wok hot

锅烧热之后加入宽油
Once the wok is hot, add in kuanyou

然后将油温烧至5成热
And heat the oil to medium heat

油温5成热之后将切好的茄子下锅炸熟炸透
Once the oil is at medium heat, add the pre-cut eggplant and fry it thoroughly

同學們茄子下锅炸的中途必须保持火力一致
Friends, once the eggplant is in the oil, keep the heat at a consistent temperature 

油温高容易炸胡油温底容易吸油
If the oil temp is too high it'll burn, if it's too low it'll absorb the oil

然后在起锅之前将茄子盘成一个圆圈后捞出备用
Finally, just before taking the fried eggplant out, spread it into an eggplant ring for mise

同學們倒出宽油可以反复使用请不必担心浪费
Friends, the discarded kuanyou can be reused, please don't worry about it being wasted

将热油倒出之后下一步开始制作
Once the hot oil is out, we will start the next step

然后将切好的肉末下锅中火爆香炒出猪油
Add the sliced pork pieces, and panfry until lard is released

猪肉爆香之后加入准备好的料头下锅翻炒均匀
When the pork is fragrant, add in the mise'd ingredients, and stir fry evenly

翻炒均匀之后下一步开始调味
After stir frying evenly, the next step is the seasoning

锅中加入蚝油8克
Add in 8g oyster sauce

加入老抽2克调底色
Add in aged dark soy sauce 2g for base color

加入生抽酱油4克从锅边淋入
From the edge of the wok, drizzle in 4g un-aged soy sauce

然后再加入适量的清水
Add a good amount of water

锅中加入少许食用盐调咸味
Add a bit of salt for saltiness

加入一点点胡椒粉
Add a little bit of ground pepper powder

最后加入少许的白糖提鲜
Finally add some white sugar for umami

调好味之后加入适量的水淀粉把汤汁收浓（土豆淀粉）
Once the seasoning is fully mixed, add sweet potato starch to thicken it into a sauce

汤汁收浓后将炸好的茄子下锅烧2分钟烧至入味
When the sauce is thickened, add the fried eggplants and simmer for 2 minutes to absorb flavor

中途可以用筷子把茄子再盘得圆一些
While simmering, you can use chopsticks to spread out the eggplant even rounder

這樣更加的美觀
This way it looks even prettier

2分钟之后撒入适量的葱花即可出锅装盘
After 2 minutes, add chopped scallions and it'll be ready for plating

一道非常美观下饭的盘龙茄子就制作完成
A very beautiful and flavorful "Eggplant Dragon on a Plate" is thus complete

下面开始技术总结
Next we will begin the technical summary:

第一，最好选择紧实且嫩的茄子，这样在切的时候才不容易断开
First: it is best to choose a straight and tender eggplant, so it won't split when you're slicing it

第二，茄子下锅炸的时候油温不能低于160度和高于180度，否则茄子会吸油或者炸焦
Second: when frying the eggplant, the oil must stay between 160C (320F) and 180C (356F) otherwise the eggplant will either absorb the oil or burn

第三，锅中打好汤汁后应先勾芡，茄子下锅后才能减少搅动
Third: after adding the potato starch slurry to the seasoning, thoroughly mix it together so that when you add the eggplant a minimal amount of stirring is required.
