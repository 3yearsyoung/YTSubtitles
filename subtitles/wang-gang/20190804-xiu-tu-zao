我们这个厨房已经差不多了
Now, our kitchen is basically finished

大家可以看一下这个烟囱
Let's take a look at this chimney

已经修好了
It's done

然后进来这边我刘爷做的这个灶
And here we see this stove made by my Papa Liu

刚开始还没有抹水泥和瓷砖看起来还好
At the beginning, it looked nothing special without the ceramic tiles

现在的话很漂亮
Now it looks really beautiful

你看
Look!

以前我以为做这个很简单
Before, I thought it's simple to make

其实这个还是有一些讲究
But actually it's not

这里是一个炒菜的灶
This part is a stove for stir frying

这个是炖东西的
This is for stewing

这个是做蒸菜的
And this is for steaming

烟从这里出来然后从这个烟囱排出去
Smoke goes here, and then goes out through this chimney

现在我们来回顾一下打造这个土灶的全部过程
Now, let's review how this rural stove was made

用砖块和水泥搭建灶台的雏形
Shape the stove with bricks and cement

搭建土灶排烟系统
Build the chimney for the stove

现在我刘爷在用这个线锤来测量这个烟囱的直度
Now, Papa Liu is measuring the verticality of the chimney with this plumb bob

现在大部分的人都是用激光来测量这个
Nowadays, most people use laser for this job

会用这个东西的人估计越来越少了
Fewer and fewer people know how to use this thing

不知道这个东西在你们家乡的土话叫什么
I don't know how it's called in your local dialect

烟囱勾缝
Joint filling for the chimney

烟囱扫沙
Cleaning up the chimney

我刘爷在二十多岁的时候就开始专门砌这个灶台
Papa Liu started building stoves like this since he was 20

至今为止已经有四十多年了
Till now, it's been over 40 years

像他们这样老一辈的师傅
For older-generation masters like him,

也见证了这个中式传统厨房
they have witnessed how traditional Chinese kitchens

土灶台的改革
and traditional stoves like this evolve

我估计再过一段时间
I guess after some period of time

打土灶这个手艺
skills to make such traditional stoves

也会要失传了
will be lost

所以我决定拍下这一段视频来记录一下
So I decided to make this video to record

老师傅留下的传统手艺
the traditional skills of the old masters

一个传统的中式土灶就制作完成
Now, a traditional Chinese rural stove is done!
