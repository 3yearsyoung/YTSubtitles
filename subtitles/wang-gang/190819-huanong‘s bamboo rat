这个竹鼠就是我新认的兄弟送给我的
My new sworn bro gifted the Rhizomys to me

我跟他念了一年多终于送给我两只竹鼠
I had been nagging him for more than a year untill he finally sent me two

他说我最近人消瘦了
He said I've lost weight lately 

送给我补一下
The gift therefore counts as a dietary supplement

这个竹鼠很不错
The Rhizomys are quite good

还是很感谢我这个刘苏良兄弟
Kudos to my bro Liu Suliang(Hunong Brother)

虽然说我这个兄弟从不吃亏
My bro's famous for never taking any loses

但是这一次还是把这个竹鼠送了一对给我
yet he still asked someone to bring me a pair...

还托人从那么远拉过来
... and from quite a distance

非常不容易
Not an easy task

当然这个的话也不会辜负他的一番美意
But I will definately not let him down

肯定会用我最用心最有技术含量的
I will process the Rhizomys..

来让它体现出来
...with my heart and the best technics 

也不枉他对我的一番好意
In my dearest respose to his kind act

现在这么一说他们两个很紧张在里面
They becomes very nervouse when i'm talking

跑来跑去的
Running around...

别怕啊
Don't be scared

哦对了兄弟说带你们过来是来旅游的
Also my bro told me you are here for traveling purpose

我们这儿也得给你弄个竹子吃一下
We have to get some bamboos to feed you

四伯爷那个斧子呢
Where's the uncle's axe

因为这个竹鼠可能要养几天
Because we might need to feed the Rhizomys...

养几天再弄来烹饪
...for several days before proceeding to cook them

这几天就砍竹子来喂它
We'll just feed the with bamboos the next few days
